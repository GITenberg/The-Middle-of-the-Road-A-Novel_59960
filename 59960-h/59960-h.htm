<p class='pindent'>For the twentieth time Bertram Pollard went to the door
of the little room he called his “study” and listened.
He heard nothing but the slow tick-tock of a grandfather’s
clock at the end of the narrow hall; that, and his own breathing
which seemed loud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The silence of the house in Holland Street, Kensington,
was horrible to him; yet better than the rapid footsteps of
a doctor, the quick rustle of a nurse’s starched dress, the
strange inexplicable noises of something being dragged
across the room upstairs, water being poured out, a glass
falling and smashing, and other sounds which had scared
him when his wife was in pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He’d heard her moaning once or twice, had gone back
into his room, shutting the door quietly, and saying,
“Lord! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Lord! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” and nothing else but that again
and again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In that room of his—twelve feet by fourteen, as he knew
by measuring it from skirting-board to skirting-board, as
a mechanical occupation for his nerve-tattered brain—he
had prayed, cursed, groaned, and even wept a little. He
had paced up and down, sat down at his desk, put his forehead
against the wall, gripped the mantelpiece, clenched and
unclenched his hands, behaved with a ridiculous lack of
self-control.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was frightened by his own cowardice. “This won’t
do!” he had said once or twice, and then used the words
which he had said to his own soul, not without effect sometimes,
when men had lain dead about him and his chance
of death had been as good as theirs. “Keep a stiff upper
lip, my lad!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That’s what his father had said sharply to him as a small
boy when he had taken a toss from a pony or cut his knees
in a tumble. “Keep a stiff upper lip, my lad!” That was
part of the family tradition, and it had served him pretty
well at the war—a tradition of nerve-control, endurance of
pain, hiding of fear, however frightened. It was no good
now, when Joyce was suffering torture. No damn good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His thoughts brooded over the last six months and more.
What a brute he had been, and how frightful was life which
caused women to suffer so much when this thing happened!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce had not wanted it to happen. She’d had some foreboding
of its agony, though she’d tried to hide it from him
with her usual pluck. Wonderful pluck! This girl with
“bobbed” hair, who felt that she was unfit to be seen if her
nails weren’t newly manicured, and who was as slim and
fragile-looking as a Watteau shepherdess, had the spirit of
all her family, and of many women in her crowd, as he’d
seen them in the hunting-field, in canteens, once or twice
in air-raids. He’d been more scared than this golden-haired
“kid”, as he called her then, when a bomb had fallen,
smashing the door of a house in which they had been dancing,
one night in London of war-time. His heart had given
a thump, though he was a major of machine-guns, but Joyce
had lit a cigarette with a steady hand, laughed without a
tremor, and said, “Bad miss, brother Boche!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was the night he’d asked her to marry him, if he
had the luck to get through the war. “The luck’s yours,
and my love will keep you safe!” she’d said, as he remembered
now, and would remember always.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well it had seemed luck then, though since, once or
twice, he’d wondered whether the luck hadn’t been with the
men who’d gone out before the show was finished. They’d
been saved a lot of worry—this worrying business of life
after war, with its enormous disappointments, and the whole
muddle and mystery of things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marriage was one of its mysteries. He’d gone into it as
an escape from all troubles. Funny, that! It was to wipe
out the memory of the things he’d seen. It would be the
rest-cure for body and soul, both rather badly jolted and
put out of gear by something like shell-shock. “Soul-shock,”
as old Christy had once called it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This marriage with Joyce had seemed like getting by
sheer, undeserved luck the ideal of beauty which old
Christy used to say was the secret, unattained, and unattainable
purpose of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beauty of life,” said Christy—they were sitting together
in a dug-out between Henencourt Château and the ruins of
Albert—“is God’s will on earth as it is in Heaven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He used to talk like that though he was so ironical and
blasphemous about all definite religion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beauty is the most exquisite understanding of truth and
happiness. Body as well as soul, the material and the
spiritual, must be given a chance of that, and when harmony
is established between ’em then Perfection, or God,
is attained. But we’re a long way from that at the moment,
Major, in this dirty little war of ours!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That’s what Christy had said, and Bertram had scoffed
at him as a crawling Pacifist and hot-air merchant, and
made rude, insulting remarks about his friend’s excuse for
a face, which departed abominably from beauty’s line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he’d remembered Christy’s words when he’d stood in
St. Mary Abbot’s church with Joyce. She stood beside him—he
could see her now like that, though she lay upstairs—slim,
tall, with gold-spun hair cut like a boy’s, perfectly
calm and self-possessed. “Isn’t she beautiful!” murmured
the crowd of women outside the church, in High Street,
Kensington, before they drove away, and Bertram had
agreed in his heart. She was the Beauty for which all his
soul had yearned during four and a half years of ugliness.
She was the beauty of life which had come to <span class='it'>him</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had called her that on the first night when they were
alone together in this little house in Holland Street which
she had furnished out of her own money with reckless
extravagance, a delight in weird wall-papers and sham
antiques, a passion for highly coloured cushions into which
she used to sink with little squeals of ecstasy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had been a great game of Life in those first few months
of marriage—a year ago now. Joyce had set the pace and
kept it up with amazing resistance to all fatigue. He had
pleaded for “a quiet life,” “time to love each other,” “an
escape from the crowd,” but she’d jeered at him as “an
introspective slacker,” dragged him out to theatres, dance
clubs, other people’s houses. She’d filled this little house in
Holland Street with an amazing collection of people whose
presence he’d resented sometimes with almost poisonous
hatred—young staff officers who still swaggered about
Whitehall though the war was over, young clergymen who
had been chaplains at the front, young airmen who’d put
up their wings some time after Armistice, girls who came
drifting back from canteens at Etaples, Rouen, Cologne,
with a lot of army slang and a mania for cheap cigarettes,
a sense of boredom with peace, a restless desire for “a good
time” and a most embarrassing habit of discussing sex
problems in mixed company with a complete absence of
reserve. They had come in and out of the house at all
times of the day, even to late breakfasts, where Joyce had
joined them in one of her many dressing-gowns of Japanese
silk and Futurist colours, with her bare feet in bedroom slippers,
looking like a sleepy boy, after dancing in some overheated room
until late night or early morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had quarrelled with her for that. It was the cause of
their first quarrel, “It doesn’t seem decent,” he’d said,
“and anyhow, I hate it.” That was when she’d given breakfast
in this way to one of those Army chaplains of whom
she knew so many—Peter Fynde, a young, good-looking,
conceited ass, with an exaggerated Oxford drawl, a slight
stutter, and affected gallantry. He had had the impudence
to kiss Joyce’s hand and to make some remark about her
little feet, totally unconscious of Bertram’s hot flush and
sulky discourtesy towards him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce seemed to have no regard even for the privacy of
her bedroom, and there had been another quarrel when
Bertram had come back from an afternoon stroll and found
Joyce, who had complained of a sick head-ache, “giving
audience,” as she called it, to two young officers, three girls,
and Kenneth Murless of the Foreign Office—Murless,
whom he detested most of all her friends because he was
too beautiful to live—one of those tall, curly-headed, Greek
God sort of fellows—and elaborately brilliant in conversational
insincerities. He was sitting on a low stool by
Joyce’s bed, feeding her with strawberries and cream, and
telling some ridiculous story about his life as a junior
diplomatist at the Hague before the war, to the appreciative
laughter of the company, and Joyce’s friendly smiles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram had made rather a fool of himself that afternoon.
He admitted it now, in remembrance, with a groan
of contrition. He had played the part of Petruchio in <span class='it'>The
Taming of the Shrew</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish to God you people would clear out of my wife’s
room!” he had said, with violence. “Can’t you see that she’s
suffering from head-ache and that all this chatter is the
worst thing you can do to her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That second part of his speech had been clearly dishonest.
It was not Joyce’s head-ache he was worrying about—she
seemed to have forgotten that—but his own jealousy, his
hatred of this public possession of Joyce’s room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course she hadn’t taken his explosion meekly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Bertram,” she’d said, in her pretty mocking
way, “if you don’t feel like a gentleman this afternoon, go
and walk till you do. Anyhow, don’t interrupt Kenneth’s
amusing story!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth and the rest had laughed heartily. Bertram’s
desire for them to “clear out” seemed to them a delicious
joke. It was he who cleared out, and later came back, when
they’d gone, in a rattled temper, to say things to Joyce for
which now he could have bitten out his tongue. She hadn’t
quarrelled. She’d been cool and smiling and sarcastic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Bertram, surely you don’t think marriage has
given you the prerogative of tyranny? That’s gone out of
date. My love for you doesn’t give you the right to insult
my friends. Why you should get jealous and fussed because
I receive them in my bedroom—look at all these bedclothes
and this heavy quilt!—I can’t understand. I never
heard anything so narrow-minded, so suburban! In any
case, don’t be disloyal to form. Our crowd doesn’t behave
like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our crowd!” Bertram had said bitterly. “I wish the
whole crowd would go and drown themselves. I want you
alone, to myself. You let these blighters into your bedroom,
let them kiss your hand, but if I show any kind of emotion
for you, you shrink from me. When I want to kiss you,
as I always want to, you say I’m too ‘beastly emotional’!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must admit you are, Bertram!” Joyce had said. “I
can’t stand too much of it. It bores me. I prefer intelligent
conversation, comradeship, laughter. What’s wrong
with that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marriage means more than that,” he’d said gloomily,
and then had made abject apologies for his sulkiness, and
had gone down on both knees by her bedside, so that she
had forgiven him, and tousled his hair with playful fingers.
But there had been other quarrels of the kind, worse than
that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was “nervy,” he knew that. The War had left him
all on edge. He was irritable with small things, the loss
of a collar-stud, the slackness of a servant, the continual
tinkle of the telephone bell—Joyce’s friends suggesting some
new “stunt.” Some secret warfare was going on inside his
brain, loosening his hold on old beliefs, and disturbing old
checks and balances of mind, old loyalties of tradition. If
he’d had some work to do, it would have been easier, but
England had two million unemployed, and thousands of ex-officers
like himself were wearing their boots out to find a
living wage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce had been horribly distressed when she knew that
a child was coming. All the tenderness which had overwhelmed
him at that news failed to reconcile her to the
idea, though she hid some fear that was in her. It was the
inactivity forced upon her at the end which hurt her most;
that and her loss of beauty for a time. “No more dances!”
she had cried. “No more flying stunts at Hendon. Oh,
Bertram, what a colossal bore!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been angry with her again (and now cursed himself
for that temper) because she’d insisted upon still retaining
her crowd of friends about her to the last. She’d
made no secret of her condition, even to Kenneth Murless,
and Bertram had resented that candour with painful jealousy,
shrinking from the thought that any one but himself
should be in possession of their sacred secret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s frightful!” he’d said. “It’s like exposing yourself
in the market-place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re ridiculous!” Joyce had answered. “Anybody
would think you’d been brought up at—Peckham. In the
early Victorian era. Do you think people don’t <span class='it'>know</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—but to talk about it to Kenneth Murless! That
decadent waster!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good friend of mine, whom I met long before I knew
you.” So Joyce had said, calmly and cruelly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been violently angry.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. How could he ever
forgive himself for such brutality now that Joyce lay upstairs,
between life and death! Lord! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Lord! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The supreme moment of fear came when for more than
the twentieth time he listened at the door of his study, and
heard again the horrible silence upstairs, following those
still more dreadful sounds of the activity of strangers busy
with his wife. Did this silence mean death? He asked the
question between two frightful heart-beats. Then the door
opened at the top of the landing and there was the rustle
again of the nurse’s starched dress coming downstairs.
Bertram went into his room and faced round as the woman
came in after a tap at the door. It was the verdict of life
or death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she all right?” he asked, failing to steady his voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The nurse seemed to be pitiful of his agony. His white
face and haggard eyes were like those of many men she’d
seen at such a time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your wife’s all right,” she said; “no danger now!”
She hesitated a moment, and then added nervously:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The baby was still-born. I’m sorry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She left the room again, and didn’t see Bertram Pollard
go to the mantelpiece and put his face down on his arms.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span><h1>II</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The child was a boy. It had perfect features, like a
miniature Joyce, but after a glance and a whimpering
cry, she wouldn’t look at it again. Bertram knelt by his
wife’s bedside, trying to hide the wetness of his eyes. She
put her thin fingers through his hair and caressed him, but
after a short time said, “You worry me, rather,” so that the
nurse signalled to him to go away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram had felt an immense sense of relief at the sight
of Joyce lying at peace after her ordeal. She was faintly
flushed, and had all her beauty back, with a youthful,
almost boyish look, touched by the character of her
“bobbed” hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned at the door and glanced back at her, and when
she opened her eyes again he kissed his hand to her with
all his heart in that gesture of love, but she shut her eyes
without response.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During his first reaction to the knowledge that Joyce was
safe he had not worried over the death of the baby, except
for Joyce’s sake. It was only later that he began to think
of the child. Something of himself lay dead in that cradle
in the dressing-room to which it had been carried by the
nurse. If it had lived—</p>

<p class='pindent'>His imagination wandered through the years ahead.
There would have been a companion for him, a little pal.
He would have taught the boy to ride, to play games, to
face up to life, to be a gentleman. Not a snob! No, he
would have taught him to be tolerant, and “democratic”
in old Christy’s way, with understanding of folk in the
mean streets of life. He could have told that son of his
something of the men he had commanded in the war, those
Cockney fellows who had been all nerves and all pluck with
a wonderful sense of humour. His son! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Young Bertram!
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. How fine that would have been! Life would
have been less lonely—and, Lord! how lonely it had been
with Joyce upstairs, and a nurse in the house, and the two
maids whispering about the passages while he sat alone in
his “study” with nothing in the world to study except his
introspective thoughts! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night he went on tip-toe to the dressing-room,
turned up the electric light, and drew back the coverlet
from the face of the still-born child. His son! What a
queer mite! Like a wax doll, with something of Joyce’s
look, and something, perhaps, of his own. He kissed the
tiny dead face, and then drew back sharply because of its
coldness. Not that he was afraid of death. He had seen
many men die, and dead. But this little thing was Joyce’s
babe. That was piteous! After all her suffering! Oh,
God! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Was it for the best? Had God been kind?
There was something in life now which seemed to spoil
things. Some trouble seemed to be brewing for further
tragedy. That was what old Christy thought. The old
foundations were slipping away. The War had shaken
them too much. The next generation might have to go
through worse things than their fathers. Fathers who had
been good soldiers but not much good in time of peace, and
found it hard to get a decent job!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram Pollard covered the face of the still-born child,
switched off the light, and went downstairs again. He
wrote out an advertisement for <span class='it'>The Times</span>—Joyce’s friends
would want to know—and then, for hours, sat brooding
until he fell asleep, and was only wakened by the “Lor’,
sir!” of the parlourmaid, Edith, who came in to tidy his
room. She was very sorry for him, and said so in her
chatty way.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span><h1>III</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>It was the nurse who told him how to arrange for the
child’s burial, and he went round to an undertaker’s in
Church Street, Kensington, jostled by smart women, very
bright at their morning’s shopping so that he hated them.
The undertaker’s clerk was respectful but surprised when
Bertram explained his errand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not usual, sir, to have a funeral for a still-born
infant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What then?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man coughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As a rule we just fetch them away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn it!” said Bertram, with astonishing violence, “I
want you to arrange a funeral.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He arranged for an oak coffin with a brass plate, on which
the name “Bertram Pollard” was to be inscribed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the little coffin was closed, Bertram carried it into
Joyce’s room, according to a wish she had whispered to the
nurse. It was like a toy coffin with a doll inside. Joyce’s
eyes filled with tears but she turned her head away and did
not speak a word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear! My dear!” said Bertram. Although he had
walked with death so long he was distressed beyond all
words by this little corpse. His own name on the coffin
startled him when he first saw it. It seemed symbolical
of something that had died in himself, his spirit of youth;
his hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I were you, I’d get about a bit and see your friends,”
said the nurse, as they sat together in the carriage with the
coffin on Bertram’s knee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was a nice human soul, who had been a nurse in the
War and had learnt pity for men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most of my real pals are killed,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The nurse laughed, not heartlessly but to cheer him up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See those who are still alive. It’s no use brooding.
Carry on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the old rallying word of the War. It had some
effect on Bertram even now. He straightened up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I could get a job, nurse!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We want another nice little war,” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her sideways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled back at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know you’ve thought so, sometimes! So have I.
War’s hell, of course. But there was something about
it—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the impulse that’s gone,” said Bertram. “There
doesn’t seem to be any kind of purpose—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Love, life, work,” said the nurse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram said, “Yes. Yes, of course!” and then, “I can’t
get the hang of things, quite. I’m just floundering, aimless.
And anyhow, there’s no work for my type. I was all right
with machine guns. They’re not wanted now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Men are wanted, and always will be,” said the nurse.
“Proper men, like you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That cheered him. He said no more until the tiny coffin
was lowered into the earth and the nurse and he were on
their way back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nurse,” he said, “I’ll get a job if I die for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get a job and live for it,” answered the nurse. “Here’s
luck!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span><h1>IV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce was sleeping—“as sound as a bell,” said the
nurse. Bertram had finished his dinner alone, hating
his loneliness, and the deliberately cheerful way in which
he had to answer the chatty remarks of Edith, the maid,
who waited on him with a sense of drama in the house,
and a desire to express comradeship. In his heart, though
he liked the girl, he wished her at the devil, because of his
fretted nerves, and refused a second serve of fruit jelly
with an impatience which he tried to disguise by a “Thank
you very much, Edith. Nothing more—for goodness’
sake!” Then he went into his study, shut the door, and
tried to settle down at his desk to some writing. He had
no concentration of mind. The ticking of the clock on the
mantelpiece annoyed him desperately. It had been playing
tattoos in his brain during those hours when its fast little
ticking seemed to be hurrying Joyce’s life away. Well, she
was all right now, thank God, unless the nurse and doctor
were lying to him. He went over to the mantelpiece, took
up Joyce’s photograph, and kissed it. He would try to be
less irritable and get a grip on that absurd temper of his.
Then he swore softly because the telephone bell rang again.
That was about the tenth time in the last hour. Joyce’s
friends desired to know how she was getting on. Why the
deuce didn’t they have the decency to leave him alone, and
to leave the telephone alone, at such a time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that Mr. Pollard? Oh, forgive me, but can you tell
me how dear Joyce is getting on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was the usual way of putting it. His answers were
brief. “Quite well, thanks!” then a slam down with the
receiver. He wasn’t going to give them any details.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man’s voice had spoken to him on the ’phone. “That
you, Bertram? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, I’m Kenneth Murless. How’s
Joyce?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What right had Kenneth to ask such a question at such
a time? It was like his impertinence! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And yet, somehow,
because of Joyce, who liked Kenneth, he felt constrained
to give a civil answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Getting on well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give her my love, old man,” said Kenneth’s voice on
the wire; “say I’m frightfully sorry about her loss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His love! Bertram’s face flushed deeply as he stood by
the plaguey instrument. That was going a bit too far!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid she’s not well enough to get anybody’s love
just yet,” he said icily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All my sympathy to you, old man,” answered Kenneth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This time Bertram had slammed down the receiver. He
had no desire whatever for Kenneth’s sympathy. He
wished the fellow would get his Grecian nose down to his
job at the Foreign Office and keep it there. Otherwise it
might be in danger of getting broken one day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That last ring he had answered took the frown off his
forehead after he had listened to the first words over the
wire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, is that you, mother? Yes, Joyce seems out of
danger now.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Come round? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, is the governor
at the House to-night? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Irish debate? Oh, yes,
I forgot that monstrous farce. All right. I’ll come, then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He remembered there were other tragedies in life besides
his own, more death than that of his still-born child when
he bought an evening paper at the Underground station in
the High Street, Kensington, on his way to his father’s
house in Sloane Street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Six deaths in Dublin to-day. Serious Ambush. More
reprisals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those were the headings on the front page, and he felt
sick at the words, and wouldn’t read the details. The same
thing as usual. British officers fired at and killed by boys
in civilian clothes. Young Irishmen dragged out of their
beds and shot in cold blood by “unknown men, said to be in
uniform.” Irish homes burnt by the military. Raids, bomb
outrages, searches—the usual daily record of anarchy in Ireland
which was becoming intolerable in his soul because of
his divided allegiance as half an Irishman and half an Englishman,
half a democrat and half a Tory, half a Protestant
and half a Catholic, at least, he hoped, a Christian. He
opened the paper as he sat in the district train, and saw
his father’s name on the centre page:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Great Speech by Mr. Michael Pollard, K.C.:</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;Defends Government Policy of Reprisals.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Bertram crushed the paper in his hands, and dropped it
on the seat by his side. It was his father’s field night. He
would enjoy himself vastly upholding the “absolute necessity
of putting down these murders with the firm hand of
British Justice,” appealing to the old Mosaic law of an eye
for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, denouncing those who would
treat with rebels to the Crown and “shake hands with
murder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, it would keep the governor late at the House.
That was the only comfort. He would be able to see his
mother alone, and avoid a savage altercation with his father,
who treated him as a traitor to the British Empire—Bertram
Pollard, D.S.O., M.C., who had been three times
wounded in the Great War, and loved England with a kind
of passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She met him in the hall of the house in Sloane Street,
and at the sight of her little figure and sad face, his jangled
nerves, so tautly drawn during Joyce’s long ordeal, gave a
kind of snap, and when he put his arms round her he
dropped his forehead on to her shoulder, and his eyes filled
with tears, as in the old days when he came home from
school, or left her after the holidays.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My poor boy!” she said soothingly, “I understand.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I’m sorry about the poor little baby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took him by the hand into her small sitting-room and
asked him to tell her all the details of his ordeal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joyce’s ordeal, mother!” he said, but she shook her head,
and said, “It’s worse for the men, if they’re sensitive. The
agony of waiting—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were many things he wanted to tell his mother, this
little woman with her thin grey hair, and her worn face
and kind brown eyes, to whom, as a boy, he had told all his
secrets, confessed all his peccadilloes, and had no worse
reproof than “Oh, darling!” She had spoilt him as she had
spoilt all of them, Dorothy, Susan, young Digby, and himself,
shielding them from their father’s harsh and hasty
temper, his Irish impatience, his old-fashioned Protestant
intolerance—he was Southern Irish, but Protestant—with
any license of youth. She had even told “fibs” to shield
them, and they had loved her for it, and traded abominably
on her fear of “the governor” and his sudden rages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was more afraid of him than they had ever been.
Even as small children they had defied his authority.
Dorothy had been the greatest rebel, long before her marriage
to a Prussian officer whom she had met at Wiesbaden,
in 1912, when already there was a whisper of war with
Germany—pooh-poohed by Dorothy, as by many others who
knew nothing in those days about international politics, and
cared less. That was her last rebellion. Michael Pollard,
K.C., M.P., had wiped his daughter out of his mind and
heart. He hated “the Hun” worse because of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Susan! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She took a pleasure in braving his
wrath—“our Ogre,” as she called him. She never tired of
maintaining her right to breakfast in bed, which he denounced
as “the slummocky instinct of her wild Irish
blood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your blood too, father, and no fault of mine!” was her
answer to that particular argument, to which “the governor”
would answer, “Thank God the Norman strain is stronger
than the Celtic, as far as I’m concerned.” She had ridiculed
his Protestant austerity, flouted his parental commands
as “Early Victorian tyranny,” and had become a
Suffragette with a joyous assertion of “liberty” which
meant for her late dances and no questions, rather than
Votes for Women, at a time when Michael Pollard, M.P.
(not K.C. then) was a violent antagonist of Women’s
Rights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram had taken Susan’s part in these domestic scenes,
but Dorothy had been his favourite sister, his best comrade,
and her German marriage, and long exile and silence during
the years of war had made a gap in his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke of her now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you heard from Doll lately?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pollard looked nervously at the door and pulled out
some letters from a little bag by her side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your father doesn’t know I hear from her. You know
he forbade all intercourse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rubbish!” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His mother confessed to a sense of guilt in having this
secret from her husband, but it was more than she could
bear to be cut off for ever from her first-born.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She writes lovingly. Her marriage—and the War—have
made no difference, except that she defends Germany
a little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram smiled at that, and said, “I suppose it is natural,
but it takes a lot of doing, as far as the war’s concerned.”
He asked about his other sister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s Susan’s latest game?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pollard looked distressed. Again she gave that
frightened glance at the door, as though her husband might
come in at any moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid, Bertram! The child is devoted to the Sinn
Fein cause! It’s a passion with her, like Votes for Women
used to be. Your father threatens to turn her out of doors
if she says another word on the subject. There was a
dreadful scene yesterday morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram could imagine it. Susan delighted in dreadful
scenes. She was an Irish rose, with many thorns, sharply
pointed. No Norman coldness in <span class='it'>her</span> blood! None of her
mother’s Devonshire softness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pollard revealed more than an ordinary anxiety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid Susan will get into trouble. There was a
policeman here a few days ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A policeman? Sounds like melodrama!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He wanted Susan to give him the address of a young
Irishman named Dennis O’Brien. Susan denied all knowledge
of him, but I know she has been corresponding with
the boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram said, “My God!” and then begged his mother’s
pardon. He hid from her his own reason for alarm. He
knew Dennis O’Brien. The boy had been in the machine-gun
corps with him, and he had heard news of him from
Ireland. It was not news to be talked of lightly. He was
up to the neck in Sinn Fein.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s Susan now?” he asked abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pollard’s hands fluttered up to her forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do I ever know? Modern mothers aren’t taken into
their daughters’ confidence. They come and go as they
please, and resent all questioning. It wasn’t so in my
young days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram smiled at the last words. How often he had
heard them! How often he and the two girls—rebels three—had
laughed at them, years back, as children. His
brother Digby, now a “Black and Tan” in Ireland—horrible
thought!—had been too young to enjoy the joke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lingered on, forgetting Joyce a little, and his dead
baby, feeling a boy again with this mother whose love was
restful, and all-understanding. They talked of old times,
and she wept a little because so much was altering and she
felt so much alone, now that Digby, her baby boy, had
gone to Ireland in the midst of all that terror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She made no allusion to Joyce’s share in her loneliness.
Joyce did not seem to like her much and kept Bertram away
from her more than was quite kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram guessed her thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When Joyce gets better, we’ll see more of you, mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will be nice, dear,” she answered quietly, but not
hopefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He left her before midnight, and was back again in Holland
Street before the Houses of Parliament had finished
a long debate on the Irish situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw by next day’s papers that his father’s speech was
reported <span class='it'>verbatim</span>, but he didn’t read it.</p>

<div><h1>V</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce was slow in getting about. “Wants cheering up,”
said the nurse who still stayed on. “But I can’t allow
visitors yet. It’s up to you, Major!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram did his best to cheer her up, and went in and
out of the bedroom bringing flowers, books, illustrated
papers, and making bright remarks about the weather and
things in general. But he was not a great success. Joyce
seemed to be fretting, and was in low spirits. She brightened
a little when the nurse manicured her, and when a
Truelove’s girl came to curl her “bobbed” hair. She was
also amused by the number of callers who came to enquire
about her health, sending up messages and so many flowers
that Bertram’s gift of bloom looked insignificant. Every
time she heard the bell ring she wondered which of her
friends it might be—Billy Simpson, Nat Wynne, Peter
Fynde—Kenneth Murless—?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has Kenneth called yet?” she asked Bertram, and when
he said, “Half a dozen times, I should say!” she looked at
him in an amused, challenging way, and said, “Nice Boy!
I think nurse must let me ask him to tea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram restrained a sudden pang of jealousy. He
mustn’t get back to that absurdity. After a short silence
which Joyce understood, he suggested meekly that it might
be as well to see members of the family first—her mother,
for instance, and his, and Susie, his sister. They would
be rather hurt if others were let in while they were kept out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce made a comical grimace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a boy you are for the conventions! Of course I
must see Mother—though I don’t see why I should see
mothers-in-law and sisters-in-law. It would be far more
fun to have Kenneth, and some of my own set. A rowdy
little tea-party to celebrate my return to Society!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord! Don’t return to that sort of thing,” said Bertram
hurriedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What sort of thing?” asked Joyce, coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He avoided a direct answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s be quiet for a bit. You and me. I want to think
things out. I must get some kind of work—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My tea-parties won’t prevent you,” said Joyce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat up in bed, and her cheeks flushed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let’s get back to the old arguments, Bertram. I
give you a free hand. I’m not jealous of any of your
friends—though I think that Socialist creature, Christy, has
an evil influence on you. I insist on having my own friends,
and meeting them when and how I like. If you don’t trust
me, it’s an insult to my sense of honour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Kid!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram spoke with profound humility and compunction.
Of course he trusted her. There was no harm whatever in
anything she did. He knew perfectly well that her comradeship
with Kenneth Murless was straight and clean and
sweet—although he hated it because of his jealous love of
her, hated all the people who surrounded her and edged him
out of that absolute monopoly for which he craved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall ask Kenneth to tea to-morrow,” said Joyce in a
determined way, “and, then, any of the crowd who want
to see me. I’m tired of this sick-room business. Never
again, I hope, after this experience!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ask any one you like,” said Bertram. He bent over
to kiss her, but she turned away from him fretfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment he stood looking down on her, hurt by
her quick movement to avoid his caress, and by the words
she had spoken, but filled with tenderness because of his
love for her. He stood like that in silence, when there was
a tap at the door, and the nurse came in with Joyce’s
mother, Lady Ottery, who went quickly to the bedside and
embraced her daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My poor darling!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, mother,” said Joyce, “my poor little baby!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the first time Bertram had heard her mention the
baby, and it touched him poignantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Ottery said, “If only I’d been with you!” and Bertram
wished in his heart that Joyce had permitted that, but
she had resisted all his persuasion to have her mother with
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother is too dominant in time of sickness,” she had
said. “Besides, it’s not fair to her, after the War, with
Rudy and Hal both killed. If anything happened to me,
she would die.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was like Joyce. If she had to suffer, she would
suffer alone and not drag others in. But Bertram wondered
if Lady Ottery would have died “if anything had
happened” to Joyce. He thought not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been with her when the news of Hal’s death had
come from the War Office. That was a year after Rudolf’s.
Ottery had handed his wife the telegram without
a word. He had been hit hard, and breathed heavily,
plucking his reddish beard and staring at a distant tree with
watery eyes. It was a July afternoon, and they were all
standing in the gardens of Holme Ottery, watching the girls
playing tennis on the lawns below the terrace. Bertram had
come up to get a drink. He remembered now the look on
Lady Ottery’s face, her thin, sharp-featured, powerful face.
Only for a moment did her lips and her eyelids quiver.
Then she smiled at her husband, a strange, proud smile,
and said, “For England’s sake! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” After that, when she
moved towards her husband and took his hand, she said:
“Poor Hal has done his bit! Rudy will be glad to see him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram had marvelled at her courage, her hardness, her
love of England, so great that she was ready to give all
her sons for its safe-guarding. He remembered telling
Christy that, when he went back from leave, and he remembered
the rage with which he heard Christy denounce
Lady Ottery’s point of view and sacrificial patriotism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Its hellish!” he said. “We’ll never stop War as long
as women like that think their noblest duty is to breed sons
for the shambles; as long as they rejoice in the death of
their well-beloved for England’s sake, or Germany’s. It’s
making a religion of the foulest stupidity in human life.
It’s upholding the tradition of war—right or wrong—as the
supreme test of virtue in a noble caste, and its blood sacrifice
as a necessary, inevitable and sacred duty. How are
we going to get peace in the world with that spirit in
women?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he had argued on, until Bertram had told him roughly
to “shut up, for God’s sake!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Ottery had turned her house into a hospital during
the War, and for three years or more had nursed badly
wounded men, never shrinking from sights of blood or
death, doing dirty and disgusting work, though never before
the war had she soiled her hands, except in the garden,
among flowers, or come in touch with the coarse and tragic
aspects of life. That was the spirit of patrician women in
England, however delicate and sheltered. It was the spirit
of an old tradition. Joyce had it still, though in many small
ways she had broken with tradition, and belonged to a new
world of womanhood, careless of conventions, free of
speech, in revolt against the old code of manners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mother and daughter! Bertram watched them as they
talked together. How immensely different, yet how alike!
Lady Ottery, with her rather awe-inspiring dignity, plainly,
almost dowdily, dressed. Joyce, with absurd little bows on
her night-dress, excited, thrusting off the bedclothes, stretching
out for a cigarette, saying “Damn” when she dropped
the match, laughing when her mother fastened up a little
button which revealed too much, announcing her intention
of having a tea-party for her “best boy,” careless of shocking
this old-fashioned mother. Yet, Bertram thought, with
the same steel, the same hardihood underneath her softness,
and the same family tradition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Ottery directed her attention to Bertram for a moment,
having previously ignored him. She disliked him,
as he knew, disappointed with her daughter’s marriage to
a penniless young officer, and suspicious of his political
views after one or two heated conversations. This afternoon,
however, she was unusually gracious, and remarked
that he looked worried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce told her that he was always worrying. He was
suffering from some soul complex, which she could not
fathom—an uneasy conscience, or a craving for the Higher
Life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too much sick-room, I expect! Husbands always get
the worst of this sort of thing. Ottery fretted unreasonably.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She alluded to a lecture she was going to deliver in London,
“The Religion of Revolution,” and trusted (that was
her word) that Bertram would go to hear it. It would
explain the cause of social unrest and might clear up some
of his little difficulties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram took the ticket she gave him, and suppressed an
inclination to groan or laugh. He could not imagine his
“difficulties” being dissolved by anything that his mother-in-law
might have to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect I’m suffering from the strain of peace,” he said
with a smile, when Lady Ottery fixed him with her lorgnette
and said he looked “hipped.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“London’s enough to depress a laughing hyena! But I’ll
take a walk in it while you and Joyce have a private chat.
I expect she’s heaps to tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce said she had nothing to tell. She wanted her
mother to give her the latest social news, the inside of the
political situation, and the state of the world generally.
Was the Prime Minister still licking the hands of Labour?
Had Evelyn got her divorce yet?</p>

<div><h1>VI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>London had a lowering influence at this time on Bertram
Pollard, and filled him with such intensity of
gloom that he began to hate the place which as a boy he
had loved with romantic sentiment as the city of endless
adventure where life’s drama was rich and full.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He remembered but vaguely the tall brick house in Merrion
Square, Dublin, where he had lived in his early boyhood,
until his father had brought all the family to England.
From their house in Sloane Street, during holidays from
St. Paul’s School, he had gone exploring the mean streets
and slum quarters of London, lounging about the bookshops
in the Charing Cross Road, peering into old churches,
strolling around the markets in Covent Garden and Smithfield,
listening to the cheap-jacks in Leather Lane, venturing
into the Italian quarter at Hatton Garden with a sense of
adventure, going as far afield as the London docks and the
back streets of Stepney and Bermondsey, where he looked
out for types of men who belonged to the novels of Jacobs
and Conrad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, in his first year at Oxford, he’d come down to
London for “binges” on boat-race night, when there were
wild rags at the music halls and tumultuous encounters of
undergraduates in Piccadilly Circus, rather drunken, but
joyous, dinners in Soho restaurants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There had been no second year for him at Oxford, because
of the war which changed everything, but as a
machine-gun officer London still pulled at his heart-strings
with a tremendous tug, and made him desperate for the
seven days’ leave which came so rarely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, Piccadilly, good-bye, Leicester Square—” The
silly old words yelled by crowds of men in khaki going to
the mud and fire of Flanders for the first time—the second-timers
didn’t sing it so lustily, unless they had been drinking—always
stirred his old sentiment for London. He repeated
the words as he lay in his dug-out at night, twelve
hundred yards from the Boche line out from Mailly Mailly
on the Somme—his first pitch—and old Christy, who lay
beside him chaffed him because more than once he spoke
the word “London” in his sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>London! He used to whisper that word with a kind of
ecstasy when he came out of Charing Cross station from
the boat train which brought swarms of leave men in those
old days of darkness and air-raids and mass emotion. The
taxi drive through Piccadilly to his father’s house was a
journey of enchantment. Back again! London! What
luck! Because it might be for the last time, every minute
of it was precious, every dimly lighted lamp was a beacon
of delight; the smell of the streets, the rushing swirl of
taxis, the beat of rain on the empurpled pavements, the
damp and fog of a winter’s night, the wet crowds outside
the theatres, the dear damned dismalness of London,
drugged him, made his senses drunk with gladness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old town had been good in those days. Now when
he went out into its streets, while Joyce was ill, he found
no comfort in it. Perhaps that was his fault. Perhaps it
was he that had changed, not London.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was the
world that had changed, and all men in it, and England
that had seemed unchanging. As Bertram wandered about
the streets, diving down some of the old highways, walking
into the outer suburbs to tire out a brain that did not
sleep enough at nights, he found that pessimism closed
about him. He couldn’t avoid it, for its gloom was in every
face he passed, on every newspaper placard, in every group
of men at every street corner, in long processions of out-of-works
whom he met in mean streets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These processions of unemployed men, all ex-service, hurt
him horribly. They carried banners with the proclamation,
“We want Work, not Charity.” They were men whom
he’d seen marching up the Albert-Bapaume road and the
Arras-Lens road, and the Ypres-Menin road, when England
and the world had needed them. They were the
heroes who were fighting in a war to end war, the boys in
the trenches for whom nothing was too good. Now they
were shabby and down at heel, some of them in the old
khaki with buttons and shoulder-straps torn off, all of them
downcast and wretched-looking. “Not charity!” they said,
but they had scouts out, shaking collecting boxes in the
faces of the passers-by, in an aggressive, almost hostile way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram could never pass one of these boxes without
putting a few coppers inside, until one day he remembered
that it was his wife’s money, not his own, that he was
giving away. The thought made him flush in the street,
and walk on with a quicker, restless pace as far as Upper
Tooting. It was absurd for him to give to the unemployed.
He was one of them, with less chance of work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At many street corners there were groups of seedy-looking
men of all ages, lounging aimlessly outside buildings
on which the words “Labour Exchange” were painted.
Bertram had only a vague idea about the service done by
a Labour Exchange. The fantastic thought came to him
that it would be a good idea to put his own name down
for any job that might suit a man like himself, pretty good
at handling men, or at any kind of organising work. That
was a good word, “organising”—and he would use it to the
fellow who ran the Labour Exchange.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in High Street, Marylebone, and he said “Sorry,”
as he elbowed a group of men hanging round the swing
doors. One of them, after a glance at him, pulled himself
up, as in the old days of soldiering, when an officer passed,
but another lad snarled at him, and said, “No officer swank
now. We’ve finished with that,” and the sentiment seemed
to please the crowd, as Bertram judged by the laugh that
followed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was kept waiting in a bare room without chairs, while
a boy scout took one of his old cards, “Major Pollard,
D.S.O., M.C.,” into an inner room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A tall man, dressed in pre-war clothes which had been
smart when new and still had style, though frayed about
the cuffs and button-holes, stood with his back to the fireplace,
and nodded to Bertram when he came in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bloody weather!” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not good,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About as good as our delightful government!” said the
man, ex-officer certainly, gentleman undoubtedly. He
twisted up a black, and obviously dyed, moustache, with a
fierce gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the government been doing now?” asked Bertram,
by way of making himself civil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still continuing to destroy the Empire, that’s all,” was
the answer, delivered with a quiet ferocity. “Look at India,
seething with revolt and delivered over to a Jewish conspiracy.
The only man who dealt with things with a firm
hand, condemned, dismissed, and disgraced. Look at Ireland.
Anarchy and murder! What’s the Government
doing there? Surrendering to traitors who ought to be
shot like dogs. Look at England—public money being
poured out like water, Government offices squandering millions,
the Government cringing to Trade-Unionists and Bolsheviks.
Look at Germany! By God, sir, Germany will
win the war yet! The Hidden Hand is still at work among
our politicians. Where are the fruits of victory? The
Government is allowing the Hun to escape the price of
defeat. It’s a damned conspiracy, sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all very difficult,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had heard this very conversation before. Almost in
the same words his own father had made a grand indictment
of the Government and all its works. Queer that this
shabby fellow, “down on his luck,” as the men used to say,
should be talking in the same strain as his high and dry
reactionary father, whose sentiments when repeated by
Bertram to Christy made that son of the people pour forth
ironical blasphemies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His new acquaintance began to tell of his own woes.
After honourable service to his country, he had been reduced
to living in a common lodging-house, seeking work
in a Labour Exchange. A horrible humiliation!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” asked Bertram. “I take it that a Labour Exchange
is to exchange labour? A pretty useful thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man with a dyed moustache stared at him blankly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you don’t think I’m a damned labourer?” he
asked, aggressively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I were!” said Bertram. “Anything rather than
lounging.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was saved further argument by the boy scout, who
called his name and opened the inner door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Labour Exchange secretary rose as he entered the
office, and said, “Take a seat, won’t you, Major?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram saw that he was in the presence of a man about
his own age, twenty-five, and a pleasant-looking fellow,
typical of the “temporary officers” who had poured out in
their thousands to France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anything I can do for you, sir?” said the secretary,
offering a box of cheap Virginia cigarettes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram explained that he was looking out for a good
job of any kind, and was disconcerted when the Labour
Exchange man laughed, dropped the “sir” hurriedly, and
said, “No good coming here, old man! Surely you’re not
so hard put to it as all that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just what I am,” said Bertram, “devilish hard
put to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What can you do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram mentioned the blessed word “organising,” but
again the secretary smiled and shook his head. Then he
asked a series of questions, like a machine-gun opening
rapid fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you write a decent hand? No? Can you type?
No? Any good at figures? No? Shorthand? No?
Knowledge of engineering? book-keeping, surveying,—any
business, trade, or profession? No?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was at St. Paul’s School,” said Bertram, “and one
year at Oxford. I’m a jolly good gunner, and I was
brought up as a gentleman. Hasn’t England any place for
my sort?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was resentful of the smiling ironical look of the man
interrogating him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not any kind of place at all, old man”—Bertram
wished he wouldn’t “old man” him so much—“unless you
have a social pull. That’s still some good for jobs in Government
offices and that kind of thing, but it’s getting less
valuable as time goes on. Without it, fellows like you—and
me—haven’t a dog’s chance. How do you think I got
this job when I became demobbed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t an idea,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, my pater is Chief Clerk of Marylebone. Social
pull, my boy! Nothing else. There are thousands of young
officers, ex-airmen, ex-everything, who’ll have to emigrate,
or starve to death. There’s no alternative.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well,
there’s one!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Join the Auxiliary Force in Ireland. ‘Black and Tans,’
as they call them. Does the idea appeal to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in the least,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Labour Exchange secretary laughed, and touched
his bell for the boy scout.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t blame you neither. A rotten game! Good day
and good luck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram had winced over that “neither.” He had been
taught to speak pretty well, but though he would not say
“I don’t blame you neither,” he hadn’t learnt enough, it
seemed, either at St. Paul’s or Balliol, to get any kind of
job in England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not without a social pull,” said the Labour Exchange
fellow. As a matter of fact, he had a social pull. His
father was Michael Pollard, K.C., M.P.—with a considerable
pull on the Tory crowd. His father-in-law was the
Earl of Ottery, related by cousinship to most of the old
blood in England. His brother-in-law, Alban, was in the
Foreign Office with Kenneth Murless and other friends of
Joyce, his wife. But none of them had offered him anything,
or suggested anything, or gone a yard out of the
way to help him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce’s people had no use for him. He didn’t belong to
their caste, though they tolerated him coldly, for Joyce’s
sake. He didn’t speak their language, as it were. He
didn’t look at things from their point of view. He was an
“outsider.” How could he bring himself to ask them for
a job? The supercilious Alban, for instance? He could
not even go to his own father, with whom he was hardly
on speaking terms, because of a hopeless divergence of
views on the subject of Ireland. “Join the Black-and-Tans,
like Digby,” would be his father’s most genial suggestion,
just like this secretary of the Labour Exchange.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet for Joyce’s sake he would have to humble himself
and ask some of his exalted relatives to put him in charge
of some department for wasting the tax-payer’s money. A
financial crisis was bearing down on him with the enormous
and imminent pressure of the Germans in March of 1918
against the British line. He had come to the end of the
money he had put by out of his pay during the war—the
very last pound of it. Henceforth it was Joyce who would
do the paying until he grabbed at a job, or begged for one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m getting dishonest,” thought Bertram, as he walked
through High Street, Marylebone, observing the mournful
look of the people he passed, and turning his eyes away
from a blinded man playing a piano organ.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Old Christy’s intensive education in idealism is wearing
off. Lord, if only I could do something worth doing—lift
the world a little out of its mess—make it safer for the
kids coming along—prevent more blinded men playing piano
organs as payment for heroism! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Was it worth while,
their sacrifice?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question that came into his brain seemed to him like
a kind of blasphemy—a treachery to his own code, and to
all the crowd who had fought for England. If that sacrifice
had not been worth while, and so many men had died
for false beliefs and hopes, then nothing in the world was
right, and all that men were taught in faith was just a lie.
Christy had said it <span class='it'>was</span> a lie, the whole make-up of civilisation,
the code of his sort of people, patriotism itself. They
had argued over that, almost savagely, and he had told
Christy to shut up or clear out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet how explain those newspaper placards which stared
him in the face from newspaper shops in the Marylebone
Road?</p>

<p class='pindent'>More Unemployed Riots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Crime Wave Spreads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No Houses for Heroes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Is Europe Doomed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reprisals in Ireland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>France Insults England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not easy to keep cheerful, to retain a fair and sturdy
optimism, to see the blessing of the victory, even after the
slaughter of the world’s best youth, when those facts were
on the placards, between High Street, Marylebone and the
lower end of Baker Street!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet Bertram Pollard, ex-officer and unemployed, did not
despair. He felt something “inside him,” as he used to say
in his childhood, which promised some kind of revelation
of all this mystery. He seemed to be waiting for a light
that would make things clear to him in his own life, and
in life. He was certain, beneath his deep uncertainty, that
he would find some job to do, some job worth doing. God,
or the great powers, or his own instincts, would give him
a chance, a new impulse, some decent object in life. After
all, he was only twenty-five, with health and strength and
desire to find the right place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Impossible that he should be useless and unused!</p>

<div><h1>VII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>A man came up in the dusk that was creeping into the
streets of London, and walked alongside Bertram.
He said something about no work, a sick wife, children,
the war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram had heard it all a hundred times from other men,
and tried to remember whether he had any money in his
pocket. Then something in the man’s voice stirred an old
memory. He halted and stared into the man’s face, and saw
that it was one of his old company, Bill Huggett, the
Cockney fellow from Camberwell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke his name, and the man was startled, and then
shamefaced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good Lord, Huggett! Have you come to this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram was distressed. This man had been with him in
the dirtiest places, on mornings of great battle, in the dreary
old routine. He had always “groused,” but had never failed
in pluck, and always cheered his comrades by his grim
humour when things were bad, and death neighbourly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what else?” asked the man, in a hostile voice. He
wanted to know what a bloke could do on twenty-five
shillings a week, out of work pay, and food prices rising
every day, and a family of brats to keep. After saving the
blasted country!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram suggested that other men had helped to save the
country, and were in the same trouble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not you, anyhow,” said the man, with an ugly rasp in
his voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me too,” said Bertram. “Let’s go and get a drink and
talk things out.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went through the swing door of a dirty public house
somewhere behind Baker Street station, and Bertram sat
opposite his former corporal at a table wet with beer dregs.
At the bar a number of seedy men, some of them in khaki
trousers under old overcoats, were drinking beer in a
gloomy way, without much conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Huggett asked for a glass of stout, which he said was
food as well as drink. He was a thin-faced fellow, with a
battered bowler hat and an old trench coat still stained with
the mud of Flanders and the Somme, and the later grease
of low class eating houses in London. By trade, as Bertram
remembered, he was a French polisher, but according
to his tale, there was “nothing doing” in French polishing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was at the end of a second glass of stout that he became
talkative, and Bertram did not like his kind of talk.
He liked it less because it expressed crudely and violently
some of the ideas that had been creeping into his own mind—the
rough deal that was being given to the men who
had fought and come back, the inequality of reward for
service done, so that while the front line men were unemployed,
the slackers, the stay-at-homes, the artful dodgers,
had captured all the jobs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at all the Generals in Whitehall,” said Huggett.
“Still strutting around as though the war was on, with
flower gardens blooming on their breasts. Did they ever
stand in the mud up to their knee-caps, serving a blarsted
machine-gun under a German barrage? Not on your life!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They did their job as well as they knew how,” said Bertram.
“It had to be done. Somebody had to do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Huggett did not see why his job had to be done. The
war had not been to make life easier or better for ordinary
folk. It had made it harder. He was pleased to admit,
as he wiped his lips with the back of his hand, that if
Fritz had won he would have mopped up everything and
skinned England alive. He had to be beat. But after the
war? What about all the promises about homes for heroes?
A land for heroes to live in? He was one of the little
heroes, well, he’d done his bit!—but his unemployed pay
was not enough to keep a dog decent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lowered his voice, and spoke of the bitterness of men
like himself. They were getting savage. He wasn’t one to
believe in revolution, but there were others who did. They
wanted to tear down everything, drag down everybody,
smash up the whole show, and then all start level. There
were foreign chaps about, round the factory gates, in the
pubs, putting those ideas into the heads of young chaps
who were ready for them. There were a lot of little leaflets
going about—very hot stuff—pushed through letter boxes,
and into the hands of factory girls. All Huggett wanted,
and steady fellows who didn’t hold with wild stuff, was
decent wages for decent work, but there were numbers who
weren’t out for work at all. They were out for Red
Revolution—bloody red—said Bill Huggett. “And can you
wonder, sir, when there’s nothing like a fair deal for honest
working men. It’s just asking for trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram listened gloomily. He seemed to hear in the
words of Bill Huggett, this thin-faced Cockney, the voice
of the underworld, not heard in Parliament or in the Press,
the murmur of masses of men, discontented, bitter, restless,
out of work, wondering, as he had asked himself, whether
all the sacrifice had been worth while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He switched the conversation on to another line, less
worrying to his troubled mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’s your wife, Huggett?” He remembered the man
had kept his wife’s photograph in his tunic during his time
with the machine-gun company, and had shown it to him
once with pride—the photograph of a plain-faced girl, in a
cheap blouse and hat with “fevvers.” Huggett took it out
of his pocket now, and dropped it in the beer-dregs on the
table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She ain’t like that now. You remember I showed it to
you one day at Mally Mally, down on the Somme? It was
after that she went clean off her dot. After an air raid.
They took her away, and I’m alone with the kids. Christ!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man’s voice broke, and he drew his hand over his
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram said something in sympathy. What was the use?
Presently he paid for the beer, and then took off his wrist
watch and pushed it over to Bill Huggett.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might get something on that. It might help a bit.
I’ve no money to give you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Huggett stared at the wrist watch. It had been synchronised
for zero hour in many mornings of battle. The young
Major had worn it day and night, was always shooting his
cuff to look at it. Huggett pushed it back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t take it, not if I was starved to death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Bertram. He slipped the watch into his
waistcoat pocket and then rose from the table to go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come and see me, now and then, Huggett. We ought
to keep in touch, as ‘Comrades of the Great War,’ eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he passed out of the public house, Huggett stood up
stiffly and saluted with his hand to his battered bowler hat.</p>

<div><h1>VIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram was surprised to meet Joyce’s father in the
Charing Cross Road on a day when he thought his
elderly relative was at Ottery Park, deep in Domesday
Book, or the Manorial system of England, or the Rights of
Villeinage, or some other musty historical work in which he
seemed to find much interest and drama, in spite of the more
exciting events of contemporary life. Bertram wouldn’t
have noticed him but for the remarks of two passers-by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know that old buffer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Who?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Earl of Ottery. You remember? Colonial Secretary
before the War. The most reactionary old swine—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram was intending to take a slogging walk up to the
north of London, to avoid one of Joyce’s tea-parties to
Kenneth Murless and his crowd—he was not in a mood for
Kenneth’s brilliant repartee—but he decided that it might
be well to have a word with his father-in-law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lord Ottery was staring in at the window of a clothier’s
shop in which a number of garments were labelled “Ready
to Wear” and “Hardly Soiled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a heavy, broad-shouldered man, with a ruddy
face, rather freckled round the eyes, and a reddish, unkempt
beard and moustache. The professional sharper would
have “spotted” him as a simple farmer up to London for
the day, and an easy prey for the gold-brick story. And
the sharper would have been extremely disillusioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you doing here, sir?” asked Bertram, touching
him on his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lord Ottery stared at him in a vague way for a moment,
as though wondering who the deuce he might be, and then
greeted him with fair geniality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s you, Bertram. Thought it might be one of those
young ex-officers who want to touch one for half a sovereign.
Why the devil don’t they enlist in the Black-and-Tans
and knock hell out of Ireland? Far more useful than
lounging about without a job to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram did not reveal his thoughts on that subject,
which were distinctly hostile. He merely repeated his enquiry
as to what brought Lord Ottery to town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father-in-law chuckled, and said he would reveal a
secret which he didn’t want all the world to know. He
was doing a little shopping to replenish his wardrobe. He
had discovered that instead of paying fabulous prices to his
tailor in Air Street, he could get excellent clothes, ready
to wear, at exactly one-sixth the price.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had already bought two lounge suits which fitted him
like a glove, except for slight alterations needed in the back
and under the arm-pits. He had also found a shop in the
Tottenham Court Road where he could buy first-class boots,
suitable for country wear, at a saving of two pounds on
those he had been in the habit of buying at Croxteth and
Trevor’s in Pall Mall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At one time, as he admitted, he would have shuddered
at the idea of wearing ready-made clothes. In the old
days, away back in Queen Victoria’s reign, he had been a
regular Beau Brummell, and never wore a pair of trousers
twice in the same week, or a neck-tie more than once after
he bought it, but now things had come to such a pass that
economy was the order of the day. Besides, what did it
matter? It used to be fashionable—<span class='it'>de rigueur</span>, even—for
the French émigrés after the Revolution to wear ragged
lace ruffles. With super-tax at two shillings in the pound,
land tax a frightful burden, and investments paying no dividends,
people like himself would be reduced to taking in
each other’s washing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He mustn’t go too far, however, in cutting down his
tailor’s bill! The other day an awkward thing had happened
to him. He had bought a wonderful second-hand
overcoat at a Jew dealer’s in Covent Garden, astrachan
collar, silk-lined, a wonderful bargain—twelve pounds, ten
shillings. Dunstable would have charged him forty for it,
at least. But when he was about to hang it up on his peg
in the lobby of the House of Lords, old Banthorp came up
and said: “Curse me blind”—everybody knows how the
old ruffian swears—“if that isn’t my old overcoat! There’s
the very hole I burnt with the stump of a cigar, just above
the third button!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I had to tell him I had bought it from a Jew
dealer, and he laughed so much I thought he would have a
stroke. But the real cream of the jest is that he was wearing
a ready-made suit himself, as he afterwards admitted.
It was he who put me on to that shop in the Charing Cross
Road. Lots of us are doing it now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram laughed, and enjoyed the joke as much as was
possible to a young man who had not yet come down to
“cast-offs,” but was unpleasantly in debt to his tailor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Things seem to be getting pretty bad,” he remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lord Ottery stopped in the middle of Trafalgar Square
and pointed his stick towards the clock tower of Westminster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The trouble is there,” he said. “Those fellows in the
House of Commons have sold themselves to the devil.
They’re not thinking of their country, but of how to keep
their jobs and their votes. Promise the people anything—the
Kaiser’s head, German gold, doles for unemployed, perpetual
peace, luxury for all, and no need to work. I’m
afraid of the future. The Empire is getting into the hands
of the Jews. Look at India! The Government is pandering
to mob-law. Look at the Trade Unions! Whitehall
is swarming with place-men, and England is governed by
a corrupt bureaucracy. Other Empires have passed. If we
don’t face realities, rule with a strong hand, cut out corruption,
get the people back to work, and stamp out the
spirit of revolution among the masses, we shall lose our old
place in the world. I shan’t live to see it, thank God. You
may.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram glanced sideways at him as he passed sturdily
down Whitehall, touching his broad-brimmed, badly
brushed, silk hat to passers-by who saluted him. It seemed
to Bertram that his father-in-law was a type of old England
that was passing. The war had thrown up new men, more
liberal in ideas, perhaps, at least less bound to old traditions,
of nimbler mind, quicker to adapt themselves to new
conditions; not so rooted in the soil of England, not so
faithful to the old code of honour, not lifted above political
temptation like those men of the old nobility, not so stupid
and conservative, but not so strong and straight in their
sense of duty, however wrong. They had served England
well in the past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m a weakling to this man,” thought Bertram. “I’m
pulled two ways, by old tradition and by new ideals. I
haven’t the faith of either. I’m a rebel against the old
caste, but doubtful of democracy. I hedge. I’m a blighted
hedger. But he stands fast on his own side of the hedge,
and will stand there, squarely, until something breaks
through and finishes his type for ever. How soon will it
be before something breaks through?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ottery seemed to answer his thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our day is done. I mean the day of the old quality of
England. A little man in there, speaking the language of
Billingsgate and Limehouse”—he pointed again to Big
Ben—“began the invasion of our rights, led the great attack.
The War and its costs have finished us. Profiteers are
buying up the old estates. We can’t afford ’em. We’ve
been hit too hard by taxes and death duties. Look at
Holme Ottery. Why, it’s bleeding me to death, though I’m
letting it go to rack and ruin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sighed heavily, and changed the conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’s Joyce?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram gave a good account of her, making no reference
to anxieties in his own heart, private, secret things which
disturbed him horribly—some change that had come over
her after the death of the baby, a dislike of his caresses, a
feverish desire for pleasure, a kind of hostility towards him
because of certain ideas of his about silly political questions—Ireland!—and
the rights of workingmen to a living wage.
What absurd cause of quarrel between husband and wife!
But, for the moment, anything seemed to serve as a cause
of jangle between him and Joyce. It was her health, poor
kid, and his aimlessness in life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He suddenly blurted out his desire for a “job” to Lord
Ottery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m one of those ex-officers you spoke about, sir! I
must get a decent billet of some kind, for Joyce’s sake. Can
you put me in the way of anything?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lord Ottery stared at him vaguely, as though he were a
long way off. He always put on that look when asked for
anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh? Put you in the way of anything? Why don’t you
join the Black-and-Tans? Knock hell out of those Irish
blackguards!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram laughed, awkwardly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sick of war. Besides, it doesn’t mean much pay.
Not enough to help Joyce with her house in Holland Street.
I want to keep my end up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lord Ottery halted at the entrance to the House of
Lords, touching his old hat to the policeman at the gate
who saluted smartly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not go into business?” he said, as though “Business”
were an open gate, easy to enter. “People are doing
it now, I’m told.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded to Bertram and then ambled into the courtyard
of the Palace of Westminster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A social pull!” thought Bertram. “The old ruffian
wouldn’t lift a little finger for me!”</p>

<div><h1>IX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>It had been a regret to Bertram—almost a distress—that
Luke Christy had not been in London lately, and he was
glad to see his signature under some article in “The New
World,” showing that he was back again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was something in Christy’s exalted pessimism, in
his bitter and almost savage irony, in a queer humour darkly
shaded by a sense of tragedy, which acted in an inexplicable
way in Bertram as both an irritant and an opiate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His own moodiness, his private doubts and difficulties,
even his bigger apprehensions of political troubles at home
and abroad, were made trivial by the intense world-ranging
analysis of social disease threatening civilisation which
Christy brought back from his journeys abroad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was seldom in London, and after a few days, or at
most, a few weeks, in his rooms overlooking the river from
Adelphi Terrace, would set out again for Paris, or Berlin,
or Vienna, or Rome, with an insatiable desire to “see how
things were getting on” in the spirit of peoples and in their
social conditions. The results of his inquiries could be read
in Radical weeklies under the heading of “Our Special
Correspondent,” in articles written with a cold scientific
touch, over-crammed with facts and statistics, and unemotional.
They revealed nothing of the flame at the heart of
this man, none of his whimsicality of expression in private
conversation, not a gleam of his philosophy, but Bertram
believed that they were valued as important contributions to
knowledge by international groups of men and women outside
his own set, and unknown to him except by references
in newspapers and in satirical comment by men like Kenneth
Murless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth called them “long-haired idealists,” “Crawling
Pacifists,” and “home-bred Bolshevists.” He had even referred
to Christy once or twice by name, and had denounced
an article of his as “a challenge to all established authority.
The fellow ought to be shot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a friend of mine,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth Murless raised his eyebrows in languid surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That so? Then you’re entertaining an enemy unawares.
A viper in your bosom, old man. Christy and his crowd
have declared war against our set and our ideals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What ideals?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Preserving the good old order of things,” said Kenneth.
“The Stately Homes of England, our Prerogatives, our
Very Pleasant Way of Life, which is already seriously
threatened by tax-collectors and the greedy clamour of an
insensate mob.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram objected violently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The mob did most of the dying in the Great War, and
now ask for a decent living wage!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For high wages and no work!” answered Kenneth in
his best unimpassioned, smiling, and supercilious manner,
which had made him successful as President of the Union,
during his third year at Oxford.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He begged Bertram not to be led astray by the snobbish
witticisms of his friends in a pampered democracy, not to
be spellbound by their facile and foolish catchwords. He
disliked the suggestion that the mob did most of the dying
in the great war. The gently of England, the old aristocracy,
poured out their blood like water in a prodigal way
at the outset as at the end, while crowds of lazy young
hooligans had to be coaxed and bribed to do their duty, and
then conscripted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even then they took refuge behind “special trades,”
“essential occupations.” There were no essential occupations
as an excuse for staying at home by boys from public
schools and universities and county families. They just
went out and died, if need be, without a whine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s true,” said Bertram; “they played up all right.
None better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad you admit that, Bertram!” said Joyce in her
satirical voice, which Bertram knew was a challenge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was in the drawing-room of their house in Holland
Street, lying back on the sofa among a heap of flaming
cushions, with her legs tucked up, revealing her long silk
stockings. A charming, slim, golden-crowned figure in a
close-fitting jumper, so young and fresh that it was difficult
even for Bertram to believe that she had been the mother
of a child. How beautiful she was! How good to see her
well again!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why shouldn’t I admit it? Why should I even ‘admit’
it? It’s an historical fact!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re always taking sides with the common people.
Backing up Labour with a big L. It’s disloyalty to Us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram shifted moodily in his seat—a low window seat
looking out to the street where a Punch and Judy show was
being performed to a small crowd of children and nursemaids.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For God’s sake don’t talk about the common people as
though they were dirt, Joyce! They saved England. England
owes them something. Those fellows in my company—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce flicked some cigarette ash into the fireplace and put
her hands round her knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those fellows in your company! I can’t think how
you kept your authority, hob-nobbing with them so much!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram said in a low voice that they had saved his life
more than once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s ancient history,” said Joyce. “You’re always
harking back to the old war! Let’s forget it. We’re talking
about the present situation. The working people are
thoroughly lazy, utterly demoralised, and infected with Bolshevism.
They ought to be kept in their places with a
strong hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I agree!” said Kenneth Murless. “They’ve become
tyrannical and snobbish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Snobbish!” said Bertram, laughing, and making an
effort to keep the temper that was rising in him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Kenneth, observing a paradoxical argument
from afar; “the snobbishness of the working classes is disgusting.
Because they don’t wear collars and ties, they
won’t associate with men who are afflicted with stiff linen
round their necks. Because they’re illiterate, they make a
caste of illiteracy and condemn the Intellectual as a parasite
and a pariah. Their Trade Unions are more exclusive
than West-end clubs, more intolerant than mediæval Star
Chambers. Their Labour leaders are enemies of the liberty
so hardly won for England by English gentry—freedom of
speech, equality before the law, justice for rich and poor
alike, religious toleration, taxation according to wealth.
Why these fellows are all for the suppression of liberty.
Anybody who ventures to disagree with them is called a
damned reactionary. If they had their way, as in Russia,
they would prevent the free exercise of religion, and stifle
all intellectual opposition with the hangman’s rope. Even
now in England the working class is the only one exempt
from taxation, getting their education for nothing, and
blackmailing those who have accumulated a little money by
hard toil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like you,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like me,” answered Kenneth, calmly. “I confess my
little job at the F.O. is not exacting, but don’t I toil over
my sonnets—on official stationery—? Don’t I agonise in
labour to produce a gem of thought for ‘The London
Mercury’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought to go into the House, Kenneth!” said Joyce.
“Your eloquence would overwhelm Lloyd George himself.
And I will say there’s a lot of sense in your head, in spite
of your devastating beauty, and supercilious conceit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spoke in the usual vein of irony with which she set
her wit against Kenneth’s, yet with an underlying admiration
which he perceived and liked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His face crimsoned a little, and he laughed affectedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For that tribute, dear lady, my heart’s thanks! But
don’t tempt me to sully my bright soul with the dirt of
politics. Diplomacy, yes, the higher Machiavellism, but,
please, not politics! It’s impossible to keep clean within the
precincts of Westminster.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two of Joyce’s girl friends called, followed by the Reverend
Peter Fynde and an Italian countess who spoke detestable
English and made enormous eyes to Kenneth Murless—enormous
black eyes in a dead white face. Bertram
noticed that her hands were dirty, though they glistened
with wonderful rings. She called Joyce “<span class='it'>Carissima</span>.”—It
was an opportunity for him to slip away and see old Christy
again.</p>

<div><h1>X</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Luke Christy answered the rap of a little brass
knocker on a door up three flights of stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo, Major! I had an idea you’d come. You can’t
keep away from my sinister influence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saluted in an ungainly fashion, like a drunken Tommy,
and then gripped Bertram’s hand in his long, bony fingers.
He was a tall, thin, loosely-built man, with a clean-shaven
face singularly ugly because of its long, lean jaw and bulging
forehead. “An ugly mug,” as Bertram had often insulted
it, but with a bright light within, shining out of dark,
humorous, brooding eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was in his shirt sleeves, unpacking some hand-bags
amidst a litter of dirty shirts, collars, socks, pyjamas, newspapers,
and paper-backed books, and other salvage from a
long journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just come back from Poland,” he said, “by way of
Berlin. Put on a pipe and tell me all about life and London,
while I stow this wreckage away. How’s Lady Joyce and
the British aristocracy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked up at Bertram with the whimsical smile which
always twisted his face when he chaffed Bertram about his
close relationship with “bloated aristocrats.” His own
family kept a little shop in a Warwickshire village.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joyce is pretty well,” said Bertram. “She had a baby
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but it died.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Luke Christy’s twisted smile left his face, and his eyes
shone with sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Lord! That’s tragic. I’m sorry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram sat watching him “tidy up,” a process which
seemed to consist in heaving his dirty linen into a cupboard,
and flinging the paper-backed books on to a shelf already
crowded with papers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole room was framed in books, badly assorted in
size, and mostly of tattered bindings. Above them were
some rather good etchings and caricatures torn out of foreign
newspapers, fastened to the walls with drawing pins.
On the mantelpiece were photographs of several young soldiers,
one of Bertram himself, and a “homely” elderly
woman with grey hair, exactly like Luke Christy—who, as
Bertram knew—was Christy’s mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A door opened into an inner room into which Christy
plunged now and then with pairs of trousers, boots, and
other bits of clothing. It was from this inner room that he
began a monologue to which Bertram listened through the
open door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hard for a girl to bring a life into the world, and then
see it flicker out. I’m sorry to hear that, Pollard. It’s the
saddest thing for you and that exquisite little lady of yours.
Good God, yes! But for myself, I couldn’t risk it, anyhow.
I haven’t the pluck. I should be filled with dreadful forebodings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About what?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could not see Christy, but heard him moving about
the inner room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, to bring a new life into the world. Was it a
boy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Bertram, “it was going to have my name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A boy, eh? Oh, Lord, no! I couldn’t bring a boy into
a world like this. It wouldn’t be fair. Not yet awhile,
until we see how things are going to shape out. Major”—he
still kept to Bertram’s old rank—“I’m afraid I’m becoming
a coward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came to the half open door, and leant against the
frame of it, looking in at Bertram, who sat in a low leather
chair with his back to a long casement window through
which the dusk of a grey day crept from the darkening
Thames below. So Christy had often stood in the entrance
of a dug-out when he and Bertram lived in the earth not
far from an enemy’s line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you afraid about?” asked Bertram, with a
curious thrill, like the sensation he had had as a boy when
his nurse told him ghost stories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid of this civilisation of ours, and of all sorts
of forces creeping up to destroy it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an hour or more he talked of the things he had seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been to Eastern Europe, from which civilisation
was passing. Poland was poverty-stricken, disease-stricken,
and utterly demoralised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Austria was no more than the corpse of a nation which
had once been a mighty Empire, and now was a bulbous-headed
thing without a body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vienna was its bulbous head, a great capital of over two
million people without the means of life. He described the
dance of death there, the starvation of women and children,
the misery of the mean streets, the ruin of the intellectuals
and the professional classes. In the hotels and restaurants
and café concerts, foreigners were gathering like vampires
to feed on the mortality of that old centre of civilisation.
Austrian Jews and international gamblers, making paper
fortunes out of the fluctuations of paper money, guzzled
and gorged in an orgy of vice with girls who sold their
smiles for the sake of a meal or an evening’s warmth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old palaces of Vienna still stood, the great mansions
and cathedrals and churches and art galleries and museums
remained as the heritage of a splendid past, but the life that
made them had gone. When they began to crumble there
would be no money to repair them. No man or woman
could follow the pursuit of beauty and truth, painting or
music or science, as in the old days. They must either get
back to the land, and grub a sparse life out of the soil, or
starve to death. So it was with other countries, the little
new nations of the Baltic, the great Empire of Russia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He’d not been into Russia—it pulled him tremendously,
he must get there somehow—yet out on the frontier he’d
met the refugees, and heard their tale of misery. In Russia
civilisation was passing, had almost passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would have to go to Russia before long to see the
truth of things. There was a famine coming which would
destroy millions of people. Disease was already rife,
amounting to pestilence. Again, there, the only people who
could live at all were those who stayed close to the soil, and
were desperate in defence of their own produce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was Europe, a large part of it, going to return to the
Peasant State? That might happen. That would be something
to cling to, though not civilisation as it had been built
up through centuries of struggle. But worse than that
might happen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He’d been to Berlin and other German towns. What was
happening there? An immense industry of a people over-strained
by war, crushingly defeated, beaten to the earth in
pride, but desperate to regain their place in the world and
defend their national existence. They were working with
an astounding energy, adapting their immense genius to the
necessities of this peace and its penalties. Krupps’ which
had made great guns, were now turning out sewing-machines,
reapers and binders, cash registers, razors, anything
of metal for the markets of the world. But the indemnities
put upon them by the victors made all their
energy fruitless. The mark was dropping in value week by
week. Every time they paid their indemnities it dropped
lower with a rush. The printing presses poured out new
marks. That enabled them to undercut their rivals in every
market of the world, but at the same time they were bleeding
themselves to death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile France was putting on the screw, goading the
Germans to hatred again, making them vow vengeance,
some time, some day, in the future, however far ahead.
France was ready to ruin the whole world rather than let
Germany get up again, and the whole world, and England
first, would be ruined, if Germany were to go the way of
Austria and plunge over the precipice into national bankruptcy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were evil forces at work everywhere, forces of
cruelty, and greed, and stupidity, and hatred. The men of
the Old Order were keeping a grip on the machinery of
Government, arranging new balances of power, making new
alliances for an “inevitable” war. Hostile to them, were
those out to destroy all civilisation, at any cost, the revolutionaries
for revolution’s sake, the fanatics allied with the
murderers and the cave-men of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In between those two extremes, poor patient people, desiring
peace, were bewildered by the non-fulfilment of all
their hopes after so much sacrifice, and in their ignorance
turning this way and that, to false gods, to those who appealed
to their lower passions, to those who doped them
with the greatest falsehoods. There was no truth-teller to
whom the masses would listen. No high and noble leadership,
but only corrupt and unclean men, holding on to
power, or little men, honest in a little way, clinging to their
jobs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other forces were at work, biological, evolutionary, and
mysterious forces, which no man could understand or
govern. There was a new restlessness in the soul of humanity.
Some great change was happening, or about to
happen. The old checks and balances had become unhinged,
in the minds of men, in the spirit of peoples, in great races.
The coloured peoples of the world were stirring. Some
yeast in them was rising. Some passion of desire. India,
Egypt, Africa, Mesopotamia, were seething with the spirit
of revolt. He had been in the East. He had seen something
of it. The white races would have to take care.
There were other races waiting for their place. Japan and
China were changing in “the unchanging East.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What of the British Empire? Little old England, dependent
on overseas trade, on world markets which had
failed, on a mercantile marine which could not get its
cargoes, would be hardest pressed of all.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And the
spirit of revolution among men embittered by war, disillusioned
by false promises, beaten back to a low standard
of life, had touched even England, at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Major,” said Luke Christy, “I wouldn’t care to bring a
son into the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram rose, and did not answer for a while. He went
to the window and stared out into the darkness creeping
over the Thames. From Christy’s windows he could see
the curve of the river, and the lights of the great old city
gleaming through the purple dusk, and the red fire from the
engine of a train passing over Charing Cross bridge, and
the head-lights of motors and taxi-cabs streaming along the
Embankment—all the glamorous life of London in the
hour between dusk and darkness of an evening in May.
A scene in modern civilisation as he knew and loved it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned round to Christy and said: “You old ghoul!
You make me shiver. It’s not as bad as all that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy laughed, and switched on the electric light, breaking
the spell of darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s my morbid temperament! P’raps I’m all wrong.
But I’m just watching, and trying to find out the drift of
things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He’d found one curious thing wherever he went, in whatever
country; he found men and women talking anxiously,
analysing civilisation, uncertain of its endurance. Was that
a good or a bad sign? The intellectuals of Greece and
Rome used to talk like that before the “decline and fall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s drop the international situation and get down to
home politics. What are you doing with yourself, Major?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Looking for a job,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Luke Christy advised him to get a soft job, in one of the
Government offices, with good pay out of the rate-payers’
pockets and no more work than an office boy could do without
knowing it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to be an honest man,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy seemed to find that uncommonly amusing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Major! The only honest men in the world are
those who are dying of starvation. All who have more than
that are rogues. I’m one of the worst of hypocrites, for
while I bleed at the heart for suffering humanity, I get a
good price for the articles in which I describe its torture
and disease.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram suddenly flushed a little, and spoke in a nervous
way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Christy, I believe I could write, if I tried. In the old
days at St. Paul’s, I had a notion—anyhow, I feel I might
do something if I had a shot at it. What do you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You?” said Christy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That word and its emphasis of surprise were not encouraging,
and Bertram found it hard to confess to his friend
that he had been writing a book, and believed that at last
he had found his object in life, and the impulse he’d been
seeking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What kind of book?” asked Christy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A book on the War.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy groaned, and cried “Kamerad!” with raised
hands.</p>

<div><h1>XI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce had gone out to a dance, leaving Bertram alone
to write his book. She had made him a fair offer to
come with her, telling him that it was his own fault if she
had to rely on other company as an escape from boredom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What company?” he asked, and looked up sharply from
his papers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some of the usual. The two Russian girls and Jack
Hazeldeane, Kenneth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram pushed his papers on one side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the use of my coming? The two Russian girls
bore me to death with their tales of the old régime and
stories of Bolshevik atrocities. And I hate to see you dancing
with Kenneth. He dances like an amorous ballet
master. Besides—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Besides what—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If there’s any dancing to be done, it’s I that want to
dance with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the time, Bertram?” She smiled at his greed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. You’re <span class='it'>my</span> wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His damnable jealousy had got the better of him again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not your property, my dear!” said Joyce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not other people’s property,” grumbled Bertram. “I’m
old-fashioned enough to object to your doing that jazz stuff
with any fellow who likes to put his arms round you. It’s
disgusting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s you that are disgusting!” said Joyce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her face flamed with sudden anger, and Bertram saw the
steel glint in her eyes. She was standing by the doorway
in her evening frock, a thing of blue silk, showing her
white neck and bare arms. The light of the electric candles
on his desk played with her gold-spun hair. Bertram loved
the look of her, and yet knew that temper was creeping up
into his brain because he could not stop her from dancing
with a man he loathed, nor hold her to himself alone, nor
get from her the absolute love he desired, hungrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s not a good word from any wife to any husband,”
he said, heatedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your word!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed and lingered at the door, looking at her husband
with a queer, half-scornful, half-enticing smile which
he did not see because he was staring at his papers. There
was even a little pity in her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better come! That book of yours is getting on your
nerves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It interests me,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know I shall hate it anyhow. I want to forget the
silly old war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everybody wants to forget it,” said Bertram, with a
touch of passion in his voice. “The Profiteers, the Old
Men who ordered the massacre, the politicians who spoilt
the Peace, the painted flappers. I’m damned if I’m going
to let them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Painted flappers?” said Joyce. “Meaning me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not meaning you,” he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks for that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She left the room, and Bertram heard Edith say the taxi
was waiting. He rose and made a step towards the door,
as though to join her after all. He wanted to go, in spite
of Kenneth and the Russian girls. He wanted Joyce’s
beauty, though he would have to share it with her friends.
But it was too late. The door had clicked behind her, and
he heard the taxi-cab drive away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was too rough with Joyce. Why shouldn’t she dance
with other men? Was it some strain of his father in him
that made him hate it so—his father’s harshness and intolerance.
Or was it the passion of his love which Joyce
seemed to deny him—did deny him—after the death of her
baby? She did not respond to his endearments, and made
no disguise of her dislike of his caresses. Or was this
constant wrangling between them—becoming rather serious
at times—due to an intellectual challenge between their different
points of view—her patrician philosophy of life, his
democratic leanings? Anyhow, it was all very difficult.
He would have to be more careful, get a better grip on himself,
rise to more selfless heights of love, if need be, and if
possible, make a sacrifice of his very passion for Joyce’s
sake. It was all very difficult!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He constrained himself to get to his writing again, now
that he had refused her offer of companionship. Soon he
lost himself in his task, glad of the swift flow of his pen
and his savage strokes. It was strong stuff. It was a bitter
indictment of the stupidities, the blunders, the unnecessary
slaughter of men, which he had cursed in time of war because
his own men had been the victims, with the others.
Those orders from Corps Headquarters! Inconceivable!
Unbelievable in their imbecility!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had written for several hours, utterly absorbed, when
he heard the electric bell ringing in the hall. Joyce back
already? Hardly. The clock said midnight, and she was
not back then, as a rule, from one of her dances. Edith
had gone to bed, as Joyce had taken a key. He would
have to open the door. Confound it! Who on earth—</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Susan, his sister, and she had a man with her,
standing back a little behind her in the darkness of the
porch. She came into the hall with a “Hullo, Bertram!”
and the man followed her and shut the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She leant against the wall, breathing in a hard way, as
though she had been running. The man by her side was
Dennis O’Brien whom Bertram had known in France. He
kept his felt hat on his head, and his hands in his pockets,
and stood looking at Bertram in a careless, quizzing way.
But he was pale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather late for an evening call,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Susan asked whether the servants had gone to bed, and
when Bertram nodded, led the way into his study with her
friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut the door, Bertram, old boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram obeyed her. He had a sense of apprehension.
There was something strange in his sister’s look and
manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the game?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Susan took one of his cigarettes and lit it by a spill from
the fire before answering. O’Brien sat down in Bertram’s
desk chair, and held his hat between his knees. He was
wearing a trench coat, and looked shabby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s like this, Bertram. Dennis, who, by the way, is my
man—we married a week ago—is ‘on the run,’ as they call
it. He’s very much wanted by the English police, and I’m
going to ask you to be sport enough to put him up for a
day or two. He’ll stay close and give no trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked over at Dennis, and laughed in a low voice.
Bertram noticed that one lock of her dark hair had come
loose beneath her hat. Her brown eyes had a kind of liquid
light in them, or some leaping flame, and her cheeks were
flushed. She looked more Irish than he had ever seen her.
Perhaps it was excitement that had set that part of her
blood on fire, or the marriage she mentioned “by the way.”
Susan married! To a fellow who was “wanted” by the
English police! And the crisis in the family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram laughed, but mirthlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So O’Brien is ‘wanted,’ is he? And you’ve married him,
Susan? Any more announcements?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all for the present,” said Susan. She watched
her brother anxiously, saw his face harden a little, and then
went to him and clasped his arm with both hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bertram! You and I were always pals. You’ve helped
me out of many a scrape, and never said a word. This
affair is my worst scrape, and Dennis’s. It’s a question of
life and death. Play up to the old tradition!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to know more,” said Bertram. He spoke sharply,
and looked over at O’Brien, who was silent, with a nervous
smile about his lips. “What game have you been up to in
England? That arson business?” He remembered that
several timber yards had been set on fire at the London
docks, with Sinn Fein warnings of further damage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dennis O’Brien shifted his felt hat round, and stared at
the brim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not answering questions,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps it’s worse than arson,” said Bertram. “Were
you in Dublin last Monday?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There had been an attack outside the Castle. Two British
officers in a motor car, and three Sinn Feiners lying in
ambush had been killed. Others had escaped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dennis O’Brien became more pale, and Susan drew in her
breath sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was in Dublin,” said Dennis O’Brien. “The point is
whether you’re a friend or an enemy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m a friend of Ireland,” said Bertram, “but an enemy
of those who drench her with blood, and drag her into
anarchy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The English,” said O’Brien.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Irish too, by God!” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Brien shrugged his shoulders, and said something in a
low voice about the right to liberty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Susan threw her cigarette in the fire and put her arm
round Bertram’s neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother o’ mine! It’s no time for argument about Irish
liberty or English tyranny. Don’t you understand? Dennis
is my husband and his life’s in danger. You must hide
him here, for my sake!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram thought hard and rapidly. Susan’s words called
to his chivalry. She was this man’s wife. And it was not
easy to turn a hunted man from his door, anyway. But
what about Joyce? In hiding O’Brien he might drag her
name in, and her father’s name.—‘The Earl of Ottery’s
daughter shelters an Irish rebel.’ The newspapers would
make a fuss of that! And his own father’s name? Michael
Pollard, K.C., who defended the policy of reprisals! A
family scandal all round, and damnably dangerous!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you find another place?” he asked Susan, weakly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Susan laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The police were pretty close. We dodged ’em by the
length of a street.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She held his arm again, and said: “Big brother! Sportsman
and gentleman! For the Irish blood that’s in you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With English loyalty,” said Bertram, sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In that case,” said Dennis O’Brien, in a sullen way, “I’ll
just slope out into the streets again. I take no favour from
English loyalty. To hell with all its loyalties!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood up and went towards the door, but Susan ran
round the table to him and caught hold of his coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dennis, my dear! Bertram is all for Irish liberty. And
don’t forget I’m half English too!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All Irish now!” said Dennis, in a low, passionate voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram watched them. His face was flushed, and he
had thrust his hair back so that it was all tousled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a devilish affair,” he said, “but if O’Brien cares
to stay here, he can have that sofa!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well played!” cried Susan softly, and with those words
she kissed her brother, and her eyes were wet and shining.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not a very cordial invitation,” said O’Brien, with
sarcasm, “but if your brother gives his word—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you doubt me?” asked Bertram. His voice had a
savage note.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m in your hands,” said O’Brien, more humbly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently Joyce came in. They had not heard the front
door open, so that her appearance in the room was unexpected.
She stood for a moment in the doorway, her fur
cloak half slipping from her shoulders. Then she spoke to
Susan, not hiding her surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hulloa! Anything wrong?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps it was their silence, some look in their eyes
which suggested to her that something was “wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re looking splendid again, Joyce,” said Susan, in
her best “society” manner. There was always a sense of
armed truce between the two girls. Bertram’s sister resented
what she called the “haughty condescension” of Bertram’s
wife. Joyce had not disguised from Bertram that
in her opinion Susan was “a dangerous little spit-fire—with
atrocious manners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m quite well, thanks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce glanced at O’Brien, who had risen from his chair
as she had come in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t you introduce me?” she asked Susan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Susan said, “This is Dennis O’Brien, my husband.” It
was very calmly said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A surprise!” said Joyce. “Congratulations to both of
you, and all that, I suppose. Rather sudden, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She failed to shake hands with Dennis O’Brien. As she
had told Bertram many times, sometimes amusing times,
and sometimes not, she hated all the Irish except half an
Irishman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat in Bertram’s low arm chair, yawning a little, with
her long white arms behind her bobbed hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A cigarette, Bertram!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram gave her the cigarette, lit it for her, and mumbled
something about the late hour, and bedtime. He had a
foreboding that Joyce didn’t intend to go to bed until Susan
and Dennis had gone. And Dennis was not going. There
would have to be an explanation. There would probably
be a row.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It came half an hour later, after strained and unnatural
efforts at bright conversation by Bertram and Susan, while
O’Brien sat gloomily silent, and Joyce yawned with increasing
carelessness, and asked occasional questions without
listening to the answer. The crisis happened when she
sprang up and stretched her arms above her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t you people got any home? I hate being inhospitable,
Susan, but you and your new-found husband had
better go. Bertram and I sometimes sleep o’ nights.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a moment’s silence before Bertram answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O’Brien is staying. He’s going to use the sofa to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was another silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry,” said Joyce, “but I can’t allow that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram knew the “row” was coming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not in my contract with the maids,” said Joyce very
calmly. Then she spoke another sentence which seemed to
reveal a knowledge, or at least a guess of the inner meaning
of this visit from Susan and Dennis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Besides, my house is not going to be made a hiding
place for Irish rebels. I’m English, and play the game
accordingly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, undoubtedly, there was going to be a row!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram decided upon a frank explanation. Joyce had
the right to know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, Joyce, O’Brien is Susan’s husband, and the
police are after him. You know how I stand about Sinn
Fein.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Anyhow—I’ve given my word. O’Brien stays
here to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He does <span class='it'>not</span> stay,” said Joyce. “This is my house. If
that man is not out of it in two minutes, I’ll telephone to
the police.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She walked quickly to Bertram’s desk and caught hold of
the receiver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram followed her, still explaining, rather desperately.
He had given his word. He quite understood Joyce’s point
of view. He sympathised to some extent. This Sinn Fein
business was criminal folly. But O’Brien had been a friend
of his in the War. And he was Susan’s husband. Did she
understand? His own brother-in-law! He was in real
danger, and it was not in the code of their crowd—was it?—to
hand over a hunted man.—A criminal? Well, he
didn’t know. O’Brien had told him nothing. He asked no
questions. Besides—that was all beside the argument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve given my word, Joyce—my honour’s pledged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about my honour?” asked Joyce. Her voice was
very cold and hard. “My father’s name? Our honour to
England?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned to Dennis O’Brien, still holding the telephone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you going? Time’s up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dennis O’Brien smiled at her, and his Irish eyes paid
homage to this girl’s beauty as she stood facing him, so
hostile. He had been smiling all through Bertram’s monologue.
It seemed to amuse him, this altercation between the
English girl and his wife’s brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going,” he said. “Don’t worry at all. It’s what
one expects of English women! They would turn a starving
dog out of doors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mad dogs,” said Joyce. “With a whip.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Susan now who intervened, ragingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joyce! You’re a damned cat! No wonder Bertram has
a hellish time with you. I’d like to see the Bolsheviks playing
with your bobbed hair, and your lovely white neck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce picked up the telephone receiver, and said, “Police
station, please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took hold of Joyce’s wrist and wrenched it from the
instrument, conscious of his own violence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joyce, I forbid you. I gave my word. Surely you
respect that? By God, you <span class='it'>must</span> respect it. If you touch
that telephone again, I’ll—I’ll carry you upstairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce looked at him squarely, and their eyes met and
searched each other. She saw more anger in his eyes than
ever before. She saw that he meant to use his strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I surrender to force. Three to one, and all enemies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed on a high note, picked up her fur coat, and
went out of the room. They listened to her light steps up
the polished stairs, and to the sharp slam of her bedroom
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor old Bertram!” said Susan, dabbing her eyes with
her handkerchief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned on her fiercely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How dare you speak of Joyce like that? She was perfectly
right, apart from my pledged word. If O’Brien plays
the rebel, let him take the risk of rebels, without crawling
into English houses for a hiding place!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Susan paled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Et tu, Brute!</span>” she said in a low voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spoke a whispered word to Dennis O’Brien. He
nodded, and buttoned up his trench coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, let’s be going.—Good-night, Pollard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram did not answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made no move, as he stood planted on the hearth-rug
by the fire, staring moodily at a cigarette holder which
Joyce had dropped, while his sister and her Irish husband
went out of the room, and a moment later left the house,
as he heard by the quiet click of the front door lock. He
stood there for half an hour after they had left, and then
summed up his thoughts in his usual sentence:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all very difficult!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that he went up to Joyce’s room, which was
locked. There was no answer to his tap on the door, and
he crept miserably to his own bed.</p>

<div><h1>XII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce was perplexing to Bertram after that midnight
scene with Susan and Dennis. He had expected a
painful quarrel on the subject, a denunciation by Joyce of
his behaviour, a defence on his part, an argument beginning
with generalities and ending with personalities, always dangerous
between a young husband and wife, both inclined
to passionate temper. But Joyce declined to discuss the
matter. She had stayed late in bed next day, and had come
down to luncheon with her wrist bound up. He did not
understand the cause of that bandage until he enquired and
received the answer:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You nearly broke my wrist over the telephone last night.
Perhaps you’re not aware of the violence you used.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No, he was unaware of it, and made abject apology, horribly
ashamed that he should have used physical force to his
wife. It was a coster’s way of argument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joyce! I’m immensely sorry and ashamed. But you see
my difficulty last night. I had given my word—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I refuse to discuss the affair,” said Joyce. “You know
my views. If you say another word about it I’ll leave the
house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was that. She was not even curious to know
whether O’Brien had spent the night in Bertram’s study.
Perhaps she had enquired from the maids and had satisfied
herself on that point. Yet Bertram was certain that the
incident was not regarded as trivial in her mind, and that
it had caused something like estrangement between them.
She went her own way, deliberately shutting him out of
her plans, or, at least, not consulting him, nor giving him a
chance of joining her. She was rarely at home to luncheon
during the few weeks that followed Susan’s visit, and generally
returned only in time to dress for dinner. Even then
he had no chance of private conversation, for she invited
friends to dine night after night—was it with the deliberate
intention of avoiding intimate contact with him?—and
afterwards filled her drawing-room with a miscellaneous
crowd, or went out with a party to the theatre or the
dancing clubs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram was lonely whether she stayed at home or not.
He was beginning to feel lonely in body and soul. Joyce
answered him when he spoke to her, but no more than that.
She was quite gay at times—nearly always—but it was not
into his eyes that she laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth Murless used the house as his own, “dropped in”
for dinner, or after dinner, always civil to Bertram, never
disconcerted by Bertram’s sulky manner, always bright and
paradoxical, and entertaining to everybody but Joyce’s husband,
who hated him—for no reason but that Joyce liked
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were other men whom Joyce liked, and who liked
to be liked by Joyce. The Reverend Peter Fynde, who came
from the church round the corner, was what Bertram called
a “parlour cat,” and came purring round to tea, or at nine-thirty,
after “Evensong,” with gossipy anecdotes about Lady
This and Lady That, and soulful sayings about the “Healing
Power of Faith,” the “Beauty of the Unattainable,” and
communication with the “Dear Remembered Dead.” At
dinner, when the ladies had left the table, he was inclined
to tell somewhat Rabelaisian stories, drawn from his experience
as an army chaplain. “A human fellow,” was the
general verdict about him, “a perfect dear” by the women.
Bertram thought him a perfect ass, but did not tell them so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had nothing in common with the people who gathered
round Joyce. They irritated him. Listening to their
conversation, he found their point of view “poisonous,” if
not idiotic. It was at least—and he wanted to be fair—hopelessly
reactionary. They still had a habit of talking
about the people of England as “the mob” or “the masses,”
and they spoke about “Labour” as if it were a sinister, evil,
destructive monster, and not a class of men, quite human,
for the most part rather decent, many of them the real
heroes of the war—keen to earn a living wage, desperately
anxious not to be forced back to the edge of the poverty
line, or over the edge. Millions of Bill Huggetts, and better
men than Bill—rather neurotic, always a “grouser”—but
not out for blood and terror, or anything beyond food and
shelter for a family left on his hands by a poor mad wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Labour? Bertram had been going about London getting
into touch with some of the men of his old company—“Comrades
of the Great War,” as they called themselves,
in barely furnished clubs where they gathered at night, because
of their craving for the comradeship which had been
the best thing in war. They were still restless and unsettled.
Some of them were still hardly better than “shell-shocks.”
Their minds were groping towards some solution of their
present distress—unemployment, high prices, a sense of
broken faith with them by the nation they had served.
Some of them talked glibly, as Huggett had said, about
Bolshevism and Communism. The frightful experiment in
Russia—what was the truth of it?—held some lure for
them. There were some who believed “it would do London
a bit o’ good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram didn’t believe there was much of a real revolutionary
spirit among them. They were sick of war and
bloodshed, and the “crime wave,” as the newspapers called
it, was only the work of a small minority of young men
unhinged by the cheapness of life in war, and by war’s brutality.
Bertram marvelled rather at the patience, the essential
patriotism, the commonsense of the majority of men he
met about. Any hankering after the Russian way of revolution
was but a vague vision of some system of society
which would give men greater equality of luck, and a sense
of security.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was not the opinion of the people in Joyce’s drawing-room.
They confessed to fear about the future. It was,
perhaps, the presence of two Russian girls of the old
régime, and some of the men they brought with them of
their own caste and country, which suggested the possibility
of revolution in England. They were never tired of
telling tales of Bolshevik atrocities, none of them from first-hand
evidence, but likely enough, and dreadful in detail.
The elder of them, the Countess Gradiva—Lydia, as Joyce
called her—had set up a hat shop in Mount Street, Mayfair,
where Joyce had met her and made friends. The
younger—Paula—played the violin, wonderfully, at recitals
and concerts. They were both tall, ugly, elegant girls,
speaking half a dozen languages with equal facility and passionate
gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why doesn’t England send an army and rescue my poor
country from its tyrants?” asked Lydia one night of Bertram.
“I cannot understand your English policy, your
dreadful inactivity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram had heard many remarks of the same kind by
the Russian girls. They enraged him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t your Russian men do a bit of their own fighting?
Why do they lounge about the capitals of Europe,
and expect other people to liberate Russia and restore
Czardom, and get back their wealth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a Bolshevik, then?” asked Countess Gradiva,
staring at him with black, challenging eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in the least,” said Bertram. “But I’m dead against
these fatal expeditions in which England has poured out
gold she can ill afford—with what result? More bloodshed
in Russia. Another disastrous retreat of incompetent generals,
more suffering and horror, and harryings of poor
Russian peasants. That’s how it seems to me. I may be
wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Countess Gradiva called out across the drawing-room,
which was crowded with Joyce’s friends. She had
a high, harsh way of speaking, and a shrill laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Lady Joyce! Your husband is a naughty bad
Bolshevik! He’s saying the most dreadful things, <span class='it'>ma
chérie</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He makes a habit of it,” answered Joyce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram flushed angrily at her retort, though Joyce had
spoken with a smile. He knew by the tone of her voice
that she intended to hurt him, and it hurt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell the truth, occasionally, and that’s dreadful, I admit,”
he said to Lydia Gradiva.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not the truth about Russia, you wicked man. You do
not know our poor Russia!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would go even as far as Russia, to get the truth,” said
Bertram. “Does anybody know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean I lie to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are many lies about,” said Bertram, “but I’m
not referring to you, especially.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She whipped his hand with the end of a long necklace
of amber beads, so that they stung him. Then she called
him a revolutionary monster, a Jacobin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can see you leading the English mob and hoisting the
Red Flag over the House of Commons!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The English “mob!” There it was again. Always the
talk came round to the chance of an English revolution.
Those people were afraid—even of England!</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was General Bellasis who revealed a new cause of fear
which took hold of the imagination of London society at
this time. Bellasis was one of the men who liked to be
liked by Joyce. He was still on active service—in Ireland—but
seemed to spend his time travelling between Dublin
and Whitehall, and always came to Holland Street with
flowers for Joyce, theatre tickets for Joyce, and homage in
his eyes. He looked more gallant than any hero could be—at
all times—in his uniform with many decorations—a
tall, lean fellow, with a hard, clean cut face, blue, sailor-looking
eyes, and an empty sleeve where his left arm used
to be. But he confessed that he was suffering from blue
funk (he exaggerated his symptoms) because of an incident
that had happened to him in St. James’s Street, outside the
club, that very afternoon. A wretched-looking fellow had
come up to him, offering to sell some bootlaces. “Thanks,
no,” said Bellasis. The man had followed him, whining
something about a wife and children, and thrusting the bootlaces
under his nose. “I’ve said I don’t want ’em,” said
Bellasis, as he related. “Get off with you, my man.” He
had not spoken roughly, though he disapproved of begging,
especially when every out-of-work was getting a Government
dole. But then the man had pulled something out of
his pocket and given it to Bellasis, saying, “Well, take that
for luck!” Bellasis supposed the company could guess what
it was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth Murless guessed right, first time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The silver slipper!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said General Bellasis, “the silver slipper! And I
can tell you, I don’t like it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Reverend Peter Fynde claimed that he had been
given one at Ranelagh, three weeks before. Exactly in the
same way. He had refused an importunate beggar and received
the slipper “for luck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth Murless took precedence of Fynde, in point of
time. It was two months at least since he had been given
the slipper. That was outside the Carlton. A typical incident.
A paper boy had tried to make him buy his last copy
of <span class='it'>The Pall Mall Gazette</span>. Murless had seen it already,
read every line of it. The boy had persisted until Murless
had told him to run away or he would get a box on the
ears. “Take this for luck!” said the boy. So he had the
sign of the slipper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has everybody gone mad?” asked Bertram. “The silver
slipper! The sign of the slipper! What on earth are you
all talking about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Murless who explained, in his best diplomatic style,
after expressing surprise that Bertram should not have
heard of the sinister thing. It appeared that in the time
of the French Revolution, secret agents of the Free masons
and Jacobin clubs presented silver slippers to people whom
they particularly disliked. It was not a good thing to get
one. Most of those who did perished on the guillotine.
“<span class='it'>C’est l’histoire qui se répète, mon vieux!</span>” Kenneth Murless
spoke lightly, with a smile, but there was a hint of fear
in his voice, and in the room silence for a moment, after
he had spoken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram laughed loudly and harshly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of all the old wives’ tales! And you highly educated
and extremely modern people believe such stuff as that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce lit a cigarette, and puffed out a little wreath of
smoke, daintily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hate to tell you I’ve had the silver slipper! But if the
worst comes to the worst, I hope I’ll go scornfully to death!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram looked at her, and though he did not believe the
ridiculous explanation of the silver slipper, he could not
resist a tribute of admiration in his eyes. Joyce had more
pluck than any man in the crowd. If the impossible happened,
she would go “scornfully to death!” With patrician
pride. She read his thoughts, and a wave of colour rose
to her forehead, and for a moment her eyes softened to
him. Then she turned away, with a word about the boredom
of the subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not some Ouija board?” she asked. “Peter, you’re
a wonder with the spirit world!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the Reverend Peter Fynde who took the centre of
the room. He hoped that if they experimented a little it
would be with reverence. He deprecated the frivolous way
in which some people approached the world beyond the veil,
as so many were doing it in society now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram groaned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I call it blasphemy. To me, there’s something horrible
and indecent in this attempt to ‘call up’ the dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t agree with you,” said Joyce. “The other day
we were in touch with Hal and Dudy. They spoke as they
used to—the old home slang. One could not doubt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was all being drawn from your subconscious mind,
Joyce. But I object to the whole business. It’s unhealthy.
It’s rotten and decadent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needn’t stay,” said Joyce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram did not stay. After his altercation with the
Reverend Peter, he went out to see some of his own friends,
whose ideas he liked better than those of Joyce’s crowd,
whose point of view was more like his own than Joyce’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alas, for that! Alas, for many things. How was it going
to work out between him and Joyce? Were they drifting
apart? Were they going to add one more to all those broken
marriages which had become an epidemic in English life,
after the War? No, by God, not that! It was only the
inevitable strain of early marriage. They would have to
readjust themselves a little. More patience on his side.
More understanding on hers. Tolerance. Give and take.
Politics barred. Religion barred. A sense of humour.
Success. Yes, if his book succeeded and he could establish
a literary career, paying his Scot and lot, it would make
a deal of difference. Joyce would be proud of him, and
the book would help her to understand his point of view.
Thank Heaven for the book! It kept him busy. It gave
him an object in life. It was the expression of the truth
that was in him. It was a cure for loneliness.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, the
curse of loneliness!</p>

<div><h1>XIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Luke Christy was still in town. It was when the
sense of loneliness was in Bertram that he found himself
drifting towards the Adelphi to Christy’s rooms. The
time of day or night didn’t matter. Christy was always
glad of a “yarn,” and an excuse to drop his work awhile,
when Bertram called, if he happened to be in. And he was
mostly in, not going out much to meet his friends but expecting
his friends to come to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the test I put ’em to,” he said. “If they come,
I know they love me. And I’ve never learnt how to behave
outside my own rooms. I break their china, or eat with
the wrong fork, or scandalise the servants. I’m a plebeian,
a coarse-mannered loon, hopelessly ill-educated.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy’s friends accepted the condition he imposed.
There were often several in his room when Bertram called,
smoking innumerable cigarettes, talking, talking. Remarkable
men and women, most of them, new in type to Bertram,
and wonderfully interesting. They were literary people,
journalists, social workers of one kind and another, professional
idealists. There was also Janet Welford, at times,
more interesting than any of them, and more alarming.
Now and then came a foreigner—a Russian, an Indian student,
a Belgian poet, a young Czecho-Slovak, an Austrian
musician, an American professor, even a full-blooded Red
Indian, once an officer in the Canadian flying corps, and a
brilliant young man, speaking perfectly good English, and
liberal in ideas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were all liberal in ideas. Rather too liberal, some
of them, according to Bertram’s way of thinking. He was
startled by the boldness with which they accepted the necessity
of change in the whole structure of social life and international
relations. While he was worrying out of old
inherited instincts and traditions, with some travail of
doubt, they had jumped clean beyond to more advanced
ideals than he could accept. They put no limit to their conceptions
of liberty. If Ireland wanted a Republic, then it
was her right to have it. They only questioned the wisdom
of wanting a Republic, and the political possibility of obtaining
it, with England hostile to that idea. They believed
that national independence was less desirable, less “advanced”
than federations of free peoples, linking up into
ever widening groups, until the United States of Europe
and the United States of America, and other associations
of peoples would become the United States of the World.
A distant vision!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram’s mind refused to follow them as far as that.
He balked at the first obstacle, and insisted that Ireland
had no right to greater freedom than that of Dominion
Home Rule. He believed in the link between the two countries.
England had rights as well as Ireland, her own need
of security and freedom. He did not see how England could
be safe or free, with an Irish Republic on her flank, able
to cut her communications at sea. An Irish Republic would
be a mortal blow to the old historical pride and sentiment
of England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy laughed at that argument of his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“England’s old historical pride and sentiment are going
to be rudely shocked before long, my child! She can’t
afford those antique treasures. She’s got to keep pace with
the new needs of a world ruined by those dangerous possessions
of old castes. It was historical pride and sentiment
which caused the German ultimatum in 1914, and led to the
massacre of the world’s best youth. All that’s in the Old
Curiosity Shop now. Such stuff and nonsense must be replaced,
lest we perish, by a spirit of comradeship and
commonsense between peoples. Not “My country, right or
wrong,” nor “Kaiser and Fatherland,” but “Service to the
Human Family.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe in patriotism,” Bertram had said, stubbornly,
and that confession of faith, which he would never have
stated in Joyce’s “set,” because it was taken for granted
as the very air they breathed, seemed to astonish and amuse
some of Christy’s friends, as though he had uttered some
ancient heresy in an outworn creed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patriotism has been the curse of the human race,” said
Henry Carvell, the war correspondent, who had seen more
of wars, big and little, than any man in England, and had
been a knight-errant of the pen in most countries of the
world. A heavily-built, square-shouldered man, with white
hair and a ruddy face, he spoke with a kind of smiling contempt
for Bertram’s simplicity of ignorance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a survival of the old tribal rivalry which replaced
the cave-man law when every old ourang-outang defended
his lair and his females from all others of his species.
‘This is my patch of earth. I’ve drawn a line with my
club. It marks my territory. Cross it if you dare. I’m
stronger than you. Yah!’ That’s patriotism. I’ve seen it
working out in bloodshed and brutality from the Zambesi
to the Rhine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram made a violent protest against that line of reasoning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I utterly disagree. If you deny patriotism, you rule out
human nature and one of its strongest instincts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t deny it,” said Henry Carvell, with a touch of
impatience. “I denounce it. What virtue do you see in it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Love of familiar things in life. Loyalty to the ideas
of one’s own people, their code of honour and all that.
Men will die in defence of those things, in the last ditch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why die?” asked Christy, grinning at Bertram in a
friendly way. “Why get into ditches? Why not talk it out
with the other fellow whose ideas, most likely, are exactly
the same?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hubert Melvin, the novelist, took up the argument. He
was a chubby little man with a bald head, a great expanse
of brow, and a plump, good-natured face, like Shakespeare
without his beard and dignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our friend, Pollard, is enlarging the definition of
patriotism. He seems to be talking about sacrifice for the
ideals of life. They reach beyond frontiers. They’re not
limited to a particular patch of earth hedged round by
jealousy and governed by a small group of rascals calling
themselves patriots! Of course men will die for what they
believe to be the true faith.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite so,” agreed Henry Carvell. “Unfortunately, all
national education—in a South African tribe or a European
state—is intensive suggestion to primitive minds that their
community, alone in the world, is in possession of the true
faith. Their tribal custom becomes the only code of honour.
They are encouraged to impose it, with missionary and murderous
zeal, upon the rest of humanity. German ‘Kultur,’
for example, British ‘Justice,’ French ‘Liberty,’ and so on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“British Justice is a pretty good thing,” said Bertram.
“We believe in fair play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In Ireland?” asked Christy, and Bertram was silent.
No, somehow, for five hundred years, British Justice
had rather fallen down in Ireland. It had been dragged
into the mud since the War.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These conversations in Christy’s room were altering his
whole outlook on life, drawing him further and further
away from the ideas of Joyce and her people. He resisted
some of the extreme doctrines put forth calmly, as though
they were accepted platitudes, by Christy’s friends, but he
found himself agreeing more and more with their fundamental
principles, and leaning heavily to their side of life’s
argument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These men, Henry Carvell, the war correspondent, Hubert
Melvin, the novelist, Arthur Birchington, the critic, Nat
Verney, the Labour member, W. E. Lawless, the political
economist, and Bernard Hall, the editor of <span class='it'>The New World</span>,—to
name but a few of those who came to Christy’s rooms—differed
from each other in a thousand ways of thought,
never agreed in detail, engaged each other in endless controversy,
over words, quotations, facts, ideas, philosophy,
but Bertram, as an outsider and a younger man, seemed to
discover in them some common denominator of character
and quality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What was it that bound them by invisible threads? Not
any party creed, for some called themselves Liberals, and
others Socialists, and others Individualists, and others declined
all labels. Not any code of caste, for they belonged
to different strata of English life, by birth and education.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry Carvell had been a Balliol man and a rowing Blue,
before he disappeared into the wilds of Central Africa on
his first expedition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hubert Melvin, who wrote satirical novels, had never
been educated at all, according to his own account, and belonged
to that vague, ill-defined middle-class which stretches
around London from the mean streets of Brixton to the
garden suburbs of Wimbledon, and treks northward from
the artistic seclusion of St. John’s Wood to the outer wilds
of Golders Green and Finchley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nat Verney, the Labour member, had wielded a pick in
the mines of Lancashire before taking a course, out of
Trade Union Funds, at the London School of Economics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>W. E. Lawless, the economist, had been President of the
Union at Oxford, his father was the well-known Judge, and
his mother the beautiful Gwendoline Ashley, daughter of
the actor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bernard Hall, whose editorship of <span class='it'>The New World</span> had
founded something like a new school of English journalism—critical,
scholarly, pledged to international peace, scornful
of popular clamour and political insincerity, had been educated
in France and Switzerland, and his swarthy face, his
dark, brooding eyes, and the passionate temperament which
he tried to hide under a mask of irony, came from a French
mother and a Colonel of Seaforth Highlanders, his father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A strangely assorted crowd, not more like each other in
experience and heritage than others who drifted into
Christy’s rooms. What, then, brought them together, and
inspired them with some common quality and purpose?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram thought he had found the key to the puzzle in
the word “Tolerance.” These men were wonderfully tolerant
of things that divide other men—religion, race, social
environment. Henry Carvell had been brought up as a
Catholic, Christy was an advanced sceptic on all religion,
Lawless, a Christian Scientist. They had no race hatreds.
At a time when the English people, and especially English
women, continued to keep the hate fires burning against “the
Hun” who had caused such agony in the world, these
friends of Christy’s denounced the Peace Treaty as an outrage,
because of its harsh terms to the beaten enemy, raged
against the continuance of the blockade which had forced
the Germans to accept its “humiliations” and “injustice”—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s new in our code,” said Carvell, “to make war on
women and children,”—and they believed that by generosity
the German people could be induced to abandon their
militarism and link up with a peaceful democracy in Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were times when Bertram, listening to this talk,
felt uneasy, guilty of something like treachery. These men
were too tolerant. They seemed more sensitive, sometimes,
to the sufferings of the German people than to the sacrifice
of their own. He quarrelled with them for that, and was
beaten every time in argument because he found himself
yielding to their sense of chivalry, to their belief in the
“common man,” to their faith in the ultimate commonsense
of an educated democracy, to their hatred of cruelty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No, it was not tolerance that he found the binding link
between them, for they were violently intolerant of those
whom they called “reactionaries”—all men not in agreement
with themselves—arrogantly intolerant of ignorance and
stupidity in high places. What seemed to bind them in
intellectual sympathy was hatred of cruelty, to humble men,
to women and children, to primitive races, even to animals
and birds. They were instinctive and educated Pacifists,
believing in the power of the spirit, rather than in physical
force, in civilisation rather than in conflict, in liberty and
not in oppression, in free-will, and not in discipline.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Discipline is death,” said Christy, and when Bertram
cried out against that as blasphemy, he consented to modify
his statement by admitting the necessity of “self-discipline,”
based on understanding and consent, but not imposed by
external authority.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must kill the instinct of cruelty in the human brain,”
said Bernard Hall, of <span class='it'>The New World</span>, and the flame in
him leapt through his cold mask. “We must give up teaching
our children the old cave-man stuff, about soldier heroes
and hunters of beasts. We must make it a public shame
for women to be seen wearing the plumage of lovely birds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This hatred of cruelty was at the bottom of their arguments
about the Peace Treaty. It coloured their views on
India, Ireland, Egypt, the exploitation of Africa, the Negro
problem in the United States, the unemployed problem in
England, the relations between Capital and Labour, even the
question of Divorce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was all very difficult.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It would be more difficult
with Joyce, if he allied himself definitely with this group
of men and their philosophy. He felt they were trying to
“convert” him, to win him over wholly to their side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought to join us,” said Nat Verney, the Labour
member. “Labour has need of lads like you. The younger
Intellectuals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke with a North country burr in his speech, in
spite of the London School of Economics. He was a
sturdy, youngish man—thirty-five or so—with a shock of
brown hair and a Lancashire face, hard as teak, square-jawed,
with deep-set eyes in which there was a glint of
humour, in spite of the light of fanaticism now and then,
when he was bitter against “the classes” and his great enemy
“Capital.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you write occasionally for <span class='it'>The New
World</span>—?” asked Bernard Hall. “You have the gift of
words, if I may say so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram’s heart gave a thump at that compliment from
Hall, distinguished editor, fastidious critic. Was he serious
or only sarcastic?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A realistic novel on the War,” said Hubert Melvin, raising
his Shakespeare brow, and a little plump hand. “Nobody
in England has come up to Barbusse. You could do
it, Pollard! It’s burnt into you. Give it ’em hot and
strong—‘The Old Gang!’ Put the heart of England
into it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram had glanced at Christy. He had pledged him
to secrecy about his book, and Christy kept the pledge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pollard may surprise us all!” So Christy said, and then
spoilt his speech for Bertram by a grin and a jibe. “But
we mustn’t forget his aristocratic connections! It’s hard
to break with one’s caste.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That belongs to the wreckage of war,” said Henry Carvell.
“I’m glad of the smash. Think of the entrenched
snobbishness of England in 1913! Thank Heaven that
heritage of stupidity has been blown to bits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy was not so sure that it had been blown to bits.
In time of war there had been a little mixing up. Patrician
girls had been dairy-maids, hospital nurses, canteen women.
Public school men had gone into the ranks, now and then.
Now they were all dividing again, getting back to different
sides.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram agreed with Christy, thinking of Kenneth Murless,
General Bellasis, and others. He agreed more with
Christy than any of the others. He was glad when they
went away, leaving him to “jaw” with this old comrade of
his. Christy was of simpler stuff, dead true in his estimate
of facts. What was it in Christy that caught hold of him
so? Perhaps his intense sincerity and his harsh realism.
He did not deceive himself by illusion, however pleasant
and idealistic. He told the truth as he saw it, unsparingly,
to himself as well as to others. He had revealed Bertram
to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re pulled two ways, old man,” he had said one night,
as they had sat each side of his fireplace, here. “There’s
a tug of war between two opposing ideals in your brain.
You’re a traditional Conservative, trying to make a truce,
or Coalition Government, with Liberal ideals. A foot in
both camps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A Jekyll and Hyde!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram laughed, but he had been touched by this sword
point which had pierced his armour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A Hamlet in Holland Street,” said Christy. “You want
to murder your old uncle, Tory Tradition, but you can’t
bear to ‘kill him at his prayers.’ You’re still under the
spell of Caste.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s my caste by proxy. It’s my wife’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True,” said Christy; “and out of chivalry to her, you
will deny the light that sometimes gleams in you—the fierce,
white flame of truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He quoted Scripture. It was a habit of his, though no
Churchman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘He that loveth father or mother more than me is not
worthy of me; and he that loveth son or daughter more
than me is not worthy of me. And he that taketh not his
cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A harsh doctrine, if harshly interpreted,” said Bertram.
“It sometimes leads to the cruelty which your friends hate
so much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One must be hard for honesty’s sake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy spoke of the secret in his own life which only
once before he had revealed to Bertram—on a night before
a morning of battle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I found that my wife was dragging me down into
the dirt of lies, into the squalour of self-pity and spiritual
impotence, I left her—with my blessing. It was hard—because
I had loved her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hard on her,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a time,” Christy agreed. “Afterwards she was
glad. We had nagged at each other for five years, before
the war. That gave her relief. She was sorry I didn’t
get killed. Of course I ought to have been, for her sake—perhaps
for mine. After the Armistice life became intolerable.
She had changed and I had changed—or rather,
developed on separate lines. We were worlds apart. She
hated my Socialistic tendencies. I hated her damned little
suburban philosophy. You see, she’d married beneath her.
A clergyman’s daughter. Think of that—with me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram remained silent for a while. Was Christy’s
story to be repeated in another sphere of life; in another
quarter of London? Joyce had married “beneath her”—a
peer’s daughter to a lawyer’s son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Christy, old man,” he said at last, “I believe in Loyalty.
It’s my central faith. Loyalty to one’s country, one’s wife,
one’s code of honour. Without that life, to me, is unlivable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy puffed at his old burnt pipe for several minutes
before replying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Loyalty’s good,” he admitted presently; “but to the
highest and not to the lowest. Loyalty to lies is disloyalty
to truth. That’s one of life’s little ironies. A damned
nuisance, sometimes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conversation was broken by Janet Welford, who
came in to see Christy, whom she loved.</p>

<div><h1>XIV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>That lady, Janet,—Janet Rockingham Welford, as
her name was given in full on the title pages of several
novels and below the columns of articles in <span class='it'>The New
World</span>—was an old friend of Bertram’s. Not old herself,
for she was on the vital side of thirty, but they had played
together and pulled each other’s hair at a kindergarten in
the Cromwell Road, read fairy tales together under the
trees in Kensington Gardens, and, years later, had met
each other at “parties” in the wonderful remote days before
the War—was it a thousand years ago, or in another
life. After that they had not met until, surprisingly, one
night, in Christy’s rooms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While Bertram had been in the trenches, Janet had been
at Boulogne, with more buttons to her uniform than Bertram
could boast, driving ambulances and maimed men
from the railway to the “clearing stations,” after a wild
three months with a convoy in Belgium, when she was
often under fire in Dixmude and Pervyse, more reckless of
danger than the Belgian officers and English stretcher-bearers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now she was living in a little flat in Overstrand Mansions,
Battersea Park, writing audacious fiction (Bertram blushed
when reading it), pacifist articles (rather too bitter!), and
occasional verse—very mystical—for evening newspapers.
She also found time to play the companion and guide to
blinded soldiers in Regent’s Park, to act as secretary of a
Socialist club, to speak at Labour meetings, to give evenings
at home to young men and women of advanced views,
and to call on Christy for inspiration, advice, and intellectual
refreshment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was what she called “decidedly Left but not extreme.”
Bertram, after some conversational enquiries and
experiences, found her so extreme that he could see no further
way “Left” than instant and bloody onslaught against
established order. Her political, social and moral views
made him feel that his hair was rising on his scalp. She
frightened him. She also attracted him by an irresistible
gaiety and audacity—by an overflowing good nature and
joy of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first time he’d met her in Christy’s rooms, she had
come in like a gust of south wind, calling Christy absurd,
newly-invented names because he had failed to come to one
of her “receptions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You reptilian, hypersensitive Bohunk! You self-absorbed,
psychoanalytical Pumpdoodlum!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she had seen Bertram, with an instant recognition
met by a slow-dawning remembrance in his mind. Those
big, brown eyes, that short, straight nose, that whimsical,
biggish mouth—in what former life had he seen this girl,
kissed her, if he remembered well, pulled that mass of coiled
hair, not coiled so neatly then?— Why, yes, Janet Welford!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She made a dart at him and seized him by a coat lapel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bertram Pollard, by all that’s romantic! My boy lover
of Cromwell Road! My dream knight of Kensington! He
whom first I kissed, and would gladly do again, but for
maidenly modesty and Luke Christy! Lord, how my little
heart throbs within this silken bodice!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course he was utterly embarrassed, shy as a schoolboy,
red-faced as a cut beetroot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t mind me,” said Christy. “Only I ought to warn
you that Bertram’s a married man. And his wife’s a real
lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That makes the operation safer and more delicate,” said
Janet Welford. “Bertram, for old time’s sake? To catch
again the fleeting impress of youth’s delight? How say
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She offered him her cheek. The invitation could not be
refused without default of chivalry, but he was awkward
and restrained in his salute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet Welford rubbed her cheek with the back of her
hand and said, “<span class='it'>Quelle violence! Qu’il est féroce, cet
Anglais, et formidable!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat on the arm of the old leather chair, and put her
arm round Christy’s neck and her cheek against his cheek,
and called him a beautiful pterodactyl, and a most wise old
plesiosaurus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you come vamping me too recklessly,” growled
Christy, with mock resentment. “I may be ugly, but I’m
human.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re impregnable in virtue,” said Janet Rockingham
Welford. “Alas for amorous womanhood in a world of
surplus women!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sighed deeply, and then pulled Christy’s ears, left
the arm of his chair, and sat demurely opposite Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me,” she asked, “are you one of Us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram enquired in what way, and she explained she
meant the Only Way, the Far, Far, Better Way. Was
he one of those who had turned their back on an old and
wicked world, full of old and wicked men (and women)
and marched forward with youth to the New World of
equality, brotherhood and universal peace?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Christy who murmured with a grin:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pollard’s groping towards the light.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me take him by the hand,” said Janet Rockingham
Welford. “I’ll lead him into such a blaze of light that
his young soul will be dazzled. He will see the vision of
the glory of light and the bright coloured garments of radiant
humanity.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Will you come, my friend?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it far to walk?” asked Bertram, “or must I take a
’bus?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She told him that it was no further than the Charing
Cross Road, over a bookshop, on Tuesday and Friday evenings,
at the club meetings of the “Left Wing.” She was
secretary, and would make him a probationary member.
Fee, two shillings and sixpence. Including coffee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She made other enquiries as to his political and philosophical
mentality, and found him doubtful. She diagnosed
him as a case of psychic suppression, with a political complex.
His instincts, she thought, were healthy, but his opinions
idiotic. If he would leave himself entirely in her
hands, with placid faith, she would undertake to root up
his inherited and developed prejudices, and turn him out
a fresh young soul of the Left Wing, eager for exalted
flight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your marriage, Bertram dear?” she enquired presently;
“are you fretting at the yoke, or have you acquired that
technique which makes it possible for two human beings
to dwell under the same roof-tree, day after day, even
week after week, without agony of boredom and a nerve
strain beyond endurance? Tell me frankly. I can help
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram flushed to the roots of his hair, said “Hang it
all!” and then laughed heartily. Janet Rockingham Welford
was really the most remarkable specimen of modern
young womanhood that he had yet met.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She seemed glad to amuse him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That laugh will do you good,” she informed him.
“You’ve been worrying about things. You’ve secret fears.
I expect your dreams ought to be regulated. Laughter is
the great remedy of fear. I know that from my blind
men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you ever serious?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never leave laughter far behind,” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And that was true, as he found, not in Christy’s rooms
but in hers, to which he went rather often, after that first
meeting, and in little restaurants around St. John’s Wood
or in the “Zoo,” where he met her after her work with the
blinded soldiers of St. Dunstan’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was serious sometimes, passionately serious about
the state of civilisation, the hatred between nations, the
nation’s forgetfulness of boys who had been stricken in the
War, and the objects for which they had fought, the indifference
of the lucky classes to the growing poverty, the
increasing despair of ex-soldiers, crippled men, nerve-broken
women, the cruelty of the world to starving Russia—oh,
yes, she admitted the secret spell of Bolshevism!—the
brutality of England to Ireland, the refusal of the
United States to enter the League of Nations, the trickery,
the wickedness, the corruption of European Governments
who poked up the worst passions of the crowd, and lied
to them, and played the old game of international rivalry so
that the world was being staged for another war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She dropped her fantastic way of speech in talking of
these things, and scared Bertram by the violence of her
language, and by the red flame of her spirit, reckless of all
restraint, impatient of delay, eager for “direct action” to
cure the evils which she saw and loathed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But laughter came quick upon her passion. She laughed
wholeheartedly at Bertram’s fears, his loyalty to old traditions,
his hatred of violence, his moderate views, his moralities.
She called him a Queen Victorian Englishman, an
1880 Jingo, a trimmer, a hedger, a Girondin, a disciple of
Samuel Smiles, a John Halifax, Gentleman, a Tory Democrat,
and in a moment of exasperation, a Poor Damned
Soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He caught a glimpse of her now and then, pacing rapidly
round Regent’s Park with a blinded soldier on each arm.
They laughed continually as she talked to them. They
looked happy. They chatted brightly, and they turned their
faces to her sometimes as though seeing the way in which
the wind blew a brown tress across her rose-flushed cheek,
and the brightness of her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram had hated to see those blinded soldiers, groping
their way about the Park, tapping the kerb-stone with their
sticks, standing, and listening intently, as the taxi-cabs
swirled by, afraid, melancholy, stricken. The sight of them
made him curse the war again, and go back to his book, to
write more bitterly of its anguish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Janet Rockingham Welford was at her best with
those blinded men, and he had no argument with her in that
part of her work, though in all else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went often to her rooms.</p>

<div><h1>XV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Not a word of news had come from Susan or Dennis
O’Brien, and Bertram’s anxiety had been allayed for
a time because of the argument he used to his mother, and
to his own sense of uneasiness—that no news is good news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His mother was fretting miserably. It seemed to age
her, and he noticed that she was weak in health, and no
longer had that placid resignation to the worries of life
which had made her so comforting as a mother to unruly
but devoted children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A greyness had crept beneath her skin, so white and
transparent in the old days. She seemed to have lost her
interest in the little duties of domestic life which had filled
her time in all the days and years of Bertram’s remembrance,
and it came as a shock to him, greater than any
other sign of distress in her, that on his last visit some
withered flowers remained unchanged in the vase on her
table, and her writing desk was disorderly with many letters
and household bills hopelessly mixed up, as he remarked
when she tried to find a letter from his brother
Digby. She had made a religion of “tidiness.” Susan’s
rampageous carelessness had been a source of constant annoyance
to her sense of order. This litter in her desk, and
those unchanged flowers, were signs that something had
broken in her spirit, and Bertram was shocked by that, and
by the grey sadness of the little woman who had given him
life, as she sat, with restless hands in her lap, and a kind
of hidden fear in her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was afraid because Susan hadn’t written one word
to her about her secret marriage or her present whereabouts.
That marriage, which Bertram had revealed, was
like a blow to her. She had prayed that Susan might
marry a “nice” man, so that she would settle down and
have babies, and be happy. She’d even asked God to let
her live until she had that sense of security in Susan’s happiness—her
wild, beautiful, reckless Susan. But now this
secret wedding with a young man who was in conflict with
the law, and had done dangerous and dreadful things, was
worse than anything she had feared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does the governor think?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pollard’s eyelids quivered as she looked at her
son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your father thinks it’s all my fault.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He would!” said Bertram, bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First Dorothy. Now Susan. One married to a German,
the other to an Irish rebel! It makes him feel like King
Lear, he says. He forbids me to mention his daughters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a man!” cried Bertram. “What colossal intolerance!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His mother reproved him, timidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your father’s a good man, my dear. You must be patient
with his point of view. Those dreadful politics—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram raged inwardly against his father, with a storm
of anger at the unyielding, deep-dug, inhuman prejudice of
his attitude to life, but for his mother’s sake he swallowed
the bitter words that rose in him. He tried to comfort her
by reminding her of news she’d received from young Digby.
The boy was coming back from Dublin on leave. He might
have heard something about Susan and Dennis. Anyhow,
it would be good to see him. He had been very lucky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his mother shook her head, and refused to be comforted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Digby is my chief anxiety. I lie awake at night thinking
of him in the midst of all those raids and searches
and murderous attacks. I can hardly forgive your father
for letting him join the Black and Tans, as they call them.
He’s so young. Such a child!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram growled that it was a disgrace to the family,
anyhow. The Black and Tans were dragging England’s
reputation in the mud. They were no better than hooligans.
The scum of the Army that had fought for Liberty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again his mother reproved him. They were doing their
duty In upholding law and order, she said, and Bertram
laughed bitterly, thinking of what old Christy would say to
that, and Janet Welford. But how could he argue with his
mother, so wan-looking, so melancholy? She had withered
like the flowers in her vase. He had been tempted to tell
her about his own troubles, to ask her advice about Joyce,
who was so “distant” from him now, so unresponsive to
his love.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But he could not burden his little mother
with more family tragedies. He rose and kissed her forehead,
and said, “It’s all very difficult!” It was his old
familiar jest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled at him, and seemed to brighten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve always been good and true,” she told him.
“How’s dear Joyce?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Splendid,” he told her, and then left her, to get some
news of Susan, if he could, by way of Dennis O’Brien’s
sisters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He’d been reminded of those girls by Janet Welford, to
whom he had told the story of Susan and Dennis. Janet
knew everybody, it seemed to Bertram, and he was not surprised
when she said, “Dennis O’Brien? Of course! And
his three sisters in Maid of Honour Row. Don’t you remember
how they learned dancing with us in the old days
at the Kensington Academy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, he remembered now, three little girls with pigtails
down their backs and an Irish way of speech, and a habit
of dropping rosaries out of their pockets when they danced.
They were Irish Catholics, and he and Janet, alone together
in her rooms, had discovered them at the old address
in the telephone directory, under the name of their
father, Sir Montague O’Brien.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No news is good news, as Bertram found when he went
to the O’Briens’ house. They had received news of their
brother Dennis, and it was bad. He guessed that at once,
when the maid showed him into one of the rooms of their
house in Maid of Honour Row, a little Queen Anne house
with panelled walls and a powder closet, where once the
waiting ladies of a Stuart Queen had lived, not far from
the old red-brick palace in Kensington Gardens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three O’Brien girls suited the house, and the panelled
room, painted white, with little chintz curtains in the casement
windows, and gilt-framed mirrors on the walls, and
miniatures of Irish gentry in old-fashioned dress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls whom he remembered with pigtails, had their
dark hair coiled high, and their frocks were cut low at the
neck, showing their full white throats, not unlike the portrait
of a Georgian lady over their mantelpiece. Bertram
remembered their names now, long forgotten, as he thought,
though tucked away in his subconscious storehouse of old
memories—Rose and Betty and Jane, in order of age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A young priest was with them, and Bertram, as he entered
the room, saw at a glance that they’d been praying
on their knees, for they had risen hastily at the maid’s tap
on the door. The young priest held his beads. They had
been reciting the rosary, as Catholics do, for the dying or
dead. The girls had red eyes, and tried to hide the sign
of tears when Bertram announced himself as “a kind of
brother-in-law” and asked for news of his sister Susan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A letter lay open on the table, and Rose O’Brien, the eldest
sister, handed it to him without a word, while another gush
of tears came into her eyes. It was in Susan’s handwriting
and was but a short message. Dennis had been arrested
near Dublin, and taken to Mountjoy Prison. She
was in hiding with friends they knew. It would not be safe
for her to write any more. She sent her love, and ended
her letter with the words, “God save Ireland—and my dear
Dennis!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was silence in the room while Bertram read the
letter. So Susan had crossed to Ireland with the boy, as
he had guessed. Dennis had been taken to Mountjoy
Prison. On what charge?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He asked the girls that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has Dennis done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>None of them answered. It seemed to Bertram that they
weren’t sure of trusting him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the young priest who answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does it matter to the Black and Tans what an Irishman
has done, or not done? It’s only surprising that they
didn’t kill poor Dennis at sight. It’s a Reign of Terror,
without law, without justice, without mercy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On both sides,” said Bertram, sharply. “I see no distinction
in murder—Sinn Fein or Black and Tan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The priest laughed uneasily, but into his large dark eyes
leapt a little flame of passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sinn Fein does no murder. It fights in self-defence for
the liberty of Ireland, and executes spies and murderers—the
British soldiery and their bloody rabble, the Black and
Tans.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram groaned with a kind of anguish. He had used
the same arguments with Joyce, with Kenneth Murless, with
all that crowd. But when the priest spoke them his mind
refused to admit this one-sided view, this assertion that
Ireland had no guilt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all madness,” he said. “Madness and murder. Insane
anarchy. Black-hearted crime. How can you defend
it as a Catholic priest—even as a Christian?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The priest shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re an Englishman. How can you understand the
Irish point of view? The divine passion of a people fighting
for freedom against ruthless oppression? It’s not in
your mentality.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m half Irish,” said Bertram, bitterly, “and sometimes
I wish, by God, that I hadn’t a drop of Irish blood in my
veins! But because I’m half English as well as half Irish,
I say that England cannot surrender to Irish gun-men.
You’re fighting with the wrong weapons in a dirty way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose O’Brien had whispered to the priest, and he answered
as though he had gained new understanding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t argue about Ireland with a son of Michael Pollard,
K.C.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a shrewd blow, and Bertram was silent under the
thrust of it. He turned from the priest to the three girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your brother’s wife is my sister,” he said. “What’s to
be done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose O’Brien answered him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s nothing to do but pray.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty O’Brien saw something else to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go to Dublin to-night. If the dirty Black and Tans
touch me with a little finger—I’ll lay a whip across their
faces. I’m Irish, body and soul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush, Betty, for the love of God!” said Rose, and
Jane, the youngest, said, “Be quiet, darling!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Jane who showed Bertram out of the house, after
he had written a line to Susan, in case Betty saw her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl touched his arm, and whispered to him:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not Sinn Fein, like Rose and Betty. I’m sure our
Lord wouldn’t like it. But I’m Dennis’s sister, and he’s
the noblest boy I know. Dear God! what will I do if they
take him from us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She leant up against the door-post and wept bitterly but
very quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ll send him to prison for a time,” said Bertram;
“it’s not so terrible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He kissed her hand, to make her understand his sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God help Ireland—and England!” he said, and then
lifted his hat and walked away. If he had been wholly
Irish, he would have been Sinn Fein too. His passion
would have flamed out for Irish liberty. But he was the
son of an English mother, and loved England first and best.
Why was he always pulled two ways? Why did this infernal
tug-of-war go on in his heart and brain, between the
extremes of thought? Most men walked on one side or
the other, on their own side of life’s hedge. He tried to
keep to the middle of the road, and both sides flung stones
at him.</p>

<div><h1>XVI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>That night young Digby came to see him. The boy
was not wearing his uniform in the Black and Tans.
It was not popular in London, and the authorities kept it
out of sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They greeted each other in the usual way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hulloa, old man!” from Digby. “Hulloa, young fellow!”
from Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were alone together in the “study,” Joyce having
gone out to dinner again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are things?” asked Digby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’s yourself?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel good to be in England again, after that hellish
place, Ireland! One feels safe in the streets. No need
to keep an eye over one’s shoulder. A knock at the door
doesn’t make one jump out of one’s giddy seat!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet, a little later, he started and looked towards
the door when there was the double rat-tat of a postman’s
knock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry!” he said, with a queer grin, as he fumbled for
his pipe and lit it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was barely twenty, and had escaped the Great War
by a year or two, though he had been in training as an
officer-cadet before the Armistice; a fair-haired boy, with
clear-cut, delicate features, almost girlish, and something
of his mother’s look. But altered, thought Bertram. Something
had changed in him. There was a loose look about
his mouth, and his eyes were shifty. He had developed a
slight stutter in his speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any whiskey, old man?” he asked Bertram, after some
preliminary conversation about his father and mother,
Joyce, and the right thing to see at the theatre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram produced the whiskey, but raised his eyebrows
when Digby poured out half a glass and drank it like water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say! That’s a stiff dose, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy said it was nothing. He had got into the
habit of it. Everybody drank like a fish in his crowd.
Nothing else to do in the old barracks. It was rather encouraged
by the “Officer commanding.” Even the men
could drink as much as they liked before going out on
search parties and raids. It made ’em a bit fierce and kept
up their spirits. Otherwise they would be too easy with the
Irish, especially the Irish girls, who were damn pretty, many
of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It wasn’t a pleasant thing to search girls’ bedrooms at
night. At night? Yes, of course. All search parties went
out at night, drew a cordon round certain streets, then
banged at the doors, or bashed them in, while an officer,
with a sergeant and five men or so, went through the house
looking for rebels, and fellows on the run, concealed arms,
and all that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A rotten job for a gentleman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One night he had a lot of trouble with his men. They
routed out three girls in their night-shirts—ladies, too,
and amazingly pretty—and started mucking about with
them. One girl had her night-shirt torn off, and screamed
enough to pull the house down. It was the sergeant’s
fault. He was drunk that night, and beastly amorous.
Digby had threatened to shoot him, and did actually knock
down one of the men. That sobered them up, and they left
the girls alone, but it made them savage, and in the next
house they shot a young boy—just a kid—who tried to
shut a door in their faces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Killed him?” asked Bertram in a strangled voice.
This narrative made his blood feel like boiling lead. Hot
and cold waves passed up his spine to the top of his scalp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Lord, yes! Plugged through the head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On another night there had been a hell of a scene. They
had run to earth a young rebel in Collin’s command. He
had been in the ambush at Black Rock where five Scotties
had been killed. O’Callaghan by name. His mother and
sister had hidden him in a linen cupboard. Of course, they
found that pretty quick, but the sister stood between his
men and the cupboard, with a red-hot poker, and threatened
to burn the eyes out of the first man who tried to pass her.
The sergeant drew his revolver, but the mother flung herself
at him and he had to shoot her. Then the sister attacked,
and one of his fellows ran her through with a
bayonet, to save himself from the red-hot poker. What
else could he do?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was worse when the women started screaming and
praying round their men folk. It put the fellows’ nerves
on edge. Their nerves were always on edge. They couldn’t
walk a yard without the chance of getting a sniper’s bullet
in the brain, or being plugged in the back of the head by
some fellow who had just passed, in a busy street, or a
lonely lane. That sort of thing gave a man the jim-jams.
It was worse than real war, he imagined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No wonder the men treated the Irish “rough” at times
or got out of hand and shot up a village in which some of
their pals had been killed. Killed without a dog’s chance.
What did it mean, exactly, “shooting up” a village? Oh,
just driving through in an armoured car and spraying the
windows and door-ways with machine-gun bullets. Women
and children killed like that? Often, of course. A rotten
game, but guerrilla warfare was like that.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any more whiskey, old man? Oh, thanks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went on talking, describing raids and ambushes and
reprisals, for an hour or more, until Bertram could listen
to no more of this narrative by his “kid brother” as he
used to call him. It made him feel physically sick. It
seemed to drain him of all vitality, so that he trembled at
the knees when he began to walk about the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s frightful! It’s devilish! After the Great War and
all our sacrifice for liberty! Two English-speaking peoples,
bound together by blood, by Christian faith, by heroic memories!
My God! Digby, I implore you to chuck it. Hand
in your papers. Resign. Cut your right hand off rather
than do that dirty work! It’s dishonouring. It’s filthy.
It’s murderous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Digby’s face flushed. He gulped down some more whiskey,
and lit a cigarette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s got to be done,” he said, sullenly. “Somebody’s
got to do it. It’s what happens in this bloody world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was less than twenty years old, and all his memories
were of war, and blood, and death. He was annoyed by the
emotion of his elder brother. He was also a little drunk.
Presently he said, “So long, old man, I think I’ll go and do
a show.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram had not asked him about Susan and Dennis.
When the boy had gone, he raged about the room again.
He remembered this boy, Digby, when he was a little fair-haired
thing to whom he used to tell fairy-tales in bed.
Their mother used to come and kiss them and tell them to
go to sleep. Now this! Bertram was overwhelmed by a
sense of pity for the mothers of the world.</p>

<div><h1>XVII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Tucked into the frame of the Jacobean mirror (sham
antique, but rather good-looking) over the mantelpiece
of Bertram’s “study,” was the card given to him by
Lady Ottery for her lecture on “The Religion of Revolution:
Past and Present.” He had glanced at it several times
from day to day with a sense of annoyance, as at the notification
of an impending menace, such as a date with the
dentist or any distant disagreeable and inevitable duty.</p>

<div class='lgc' style=''> <!-- rend=';small;' -->

</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Once or twice he had murmured, “Oh, Lord! I suppose
I’ll have to go!” and then, as familiar objects lose
their force of impression, he’d forgotten the lecture and its
date. It was Joyce who reminded him one morning, at the
breakfast table, to the music of an early piano organ in
Holland Street,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you’re going to Mother’s lecture?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said “Oh, Lord!” again and “When is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was on the following afternoon, and Joyce was naturally
annoyed with him when he showed signs of shirking
the engagement. She couldn’t understand, as she said,
fretfully, why Bertram disparaged her Mother’s intellectual
ability—Joyce always spoke of her Mother with a distinctly
capital M—to say nothing of her historical knowledge.
Lady Ottery had studied considerably more than Bertram,
who was a desultory reader, and had read a good deal at
the British Museum last winter, as well as belonging to the
London Library, which allowed her to take out eleven books
at a time on serious subjects.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The amount of knowledge Mother has amassed is stupendous,”
said Joyce. “Whether you agree with her or
not, I think you ought to respect her research work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram muttered something about not believing much
in book-knowledge, but retreated on that line of argument
as the author of a book which soon he hoped to present to
Joyce with love and homage, as the first-fruits of his new-found
gift. In the end, he capitulated, and agreed humbly
to go to the lecture and behave himself with due deference
to his exalted Mother-in-law. He tried to give a touch of
humour to the surrender, and obtained the glimmer of a
smile from Joyce. But she froze him by saying that she
hoped her Mother’s lecture would convert him to more
reasonable views, and make him see the frightful danger
of the opinions held by his revolutionary friends at a time
when England was threatened by mob-law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Kid!” he said, making light again of her over-serious
mood. “In the first place my friends aren’t revolutionary”—he
had to make a mental reservation of Janet
Rockingham Welford—“and in the second place, I don’t
agree that England is threatened by mob-law.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not by the coming strike?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hesitated for a moment, and then said: “The men
call it a lock-out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She called that hair-splitting over words, and though he
would not consent to that—it made all the difference to the
argument—he agreed that there would be a serious situation
in England, dangerous, even, if all the miners left their
pits, and millions of unemployed and idle men were added
to the two millions already without work. The stoppage
of coal would gradually strangle all industry, and the railways,
which were the vital arteries of the nation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There may be Civil War,” said Joyce, calmly, and Bertram
answered sharply, “Nonsense! Who suggests that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“General Bellasis. As the Home Office man, he knows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish to goodness he’d keep his precious knowledge to
himself!” said Bertram angrily, “and not come round here
mixing scaremonger politics with tea-table dalliance!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce’s colour rose slightly, as a hint that she was
“vexed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s one of the best. If you weren’t so unreasonably
jealous, I’d ask you to make a friend of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All Bertram’s nerves jangled at this suggestion of friendship
with a man he detested as one of the professional
warriors of Whitehall, with Prussian instincts and supercilious
manners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because he can put you in the way of a job. In fact, I
think he’s going to offer you one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did <span class='it'>you</span> ask him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More or less. Don’t you want a job? It’s time you
began to keep your end up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram rose from his chair, walked to the window, and
tossed a blind tassel to and fro.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently he spoke, in a low, emotional voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was hoping you wouldn’t say that! I’ll pay you back
for board and lodging when my book’s published.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She followed him to the window, and put her hand on
his shoulder, with a caressing touch, which surprised him.
It was some time since she’d done that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bertram, I’m not playing the spiteful cat. You know
it’s not my style of play. I’m not flinging anything in your
face, or any rot of that kind. But you know you want a
good job. You’ve said so a hundred times! Now General
Bellasis is ready to offer you one. Why get huffed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was melted by her words, by the old comradely tone
of them, by her hand on his shoulder. If she only knew
how a touch from her could kill his temper!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give my book a chance,” he said. “I believe I can do
something at the writing game. Meanwhile, if Bellasis has
anything to offer, I’ll think of it, seriously. What sort of
a job, do you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Organising,” she told him, and he liked the word.
“Something to do with the home defence of England—in
case of trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trouble?” He looked at her vaguely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The strike.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Lord!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He didn’t tell her why not, and indeed, she couldn’t wait
to hear why not, for some friends called with a car to take
her to Brighton for lunch and tea. But his mind went
quickly to recent conversations with some of the people
whom Joyce didn’t know and didn’t care to know—Bill
Huggett, down in Lambeth, Janet Welford, Luke Christy,
Nat Verney, the miners’ leader, Lawless, the economist,
Bernard Hall, editor of <span class='it'>The New World</span>. They also had
been talking about the coming strike, which they called a
lock-out, and had seriously disturbed his mind on the
subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy and his friends declared that the ultimatum issued
to the miners was the first challenge of Capital in a conflict
which they intended to wage with Labour, until the
spirit of the workers was broken and they were reduced
again to the cheap standards of pre-war wages upon which
the prosperity of British industry had been developed—for
the employers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the Government was squandering millions of
money on maintaining overstaffed departments filled with
“limpets” pouring more millions into Imperialistic adventures
in Mesopotamia, and the East, giving immense financial
support to any Russian ruffian of the old régime who
gathered together bands of bandits to invade the Republic,
and generally ignoring the realities of financial ruin in
Europe, following the War, they were engineering a systematic
assault on Labour, in order to weaken its political
power and reduce it to economic subjection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The heroes of the War, “our brave boys in the trenches,”
were already being branded as “Bolshevists” by Government
spokesmen. The men who had fought at Ypres, on
the Somme, and across the Hindenburg line, and whose
patient courage in years of mud and misery and devouring
death had won the War, in spite of the stupidity of generals,
and the personal intrigues of politicians, were now
to be denounced as revolutionary rascals, unpatriotic
“blighters,” who must be “taught a lesson,” and forced back
to a low standard of wages, and of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was Christy’s way of thought about the ultimatum
to the miners. It was supported with facts and figures by
Nat Verney, the Labour member. He took the trouble to
analyse the proposed scale of wages at a little conference
of writing men in Christy’s rooms, brought there by Bernard
Hall, of <span class='it'>The New World</span>. He seemed to prove that
they were less than a living wage, so grotesquely out of
scale with the prevailing cost of life that if the men accepted
the ultimatum—hurled at them suddenly without
previous warning or discussion—they would surrender their
very birthright—the right to exist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Verney spoke quietly, with a smouldering but masked
passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall fight them to the last ditch. The Government,
in league with the mine-owners—that’s certain—have forced
an issue which we’re ready to accept. We’re not afraid,
for the judgment of the people will be on our side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bernard Hall admitted that, personally, he <span class='it'>was</span> afraid.
There was a sense of bitterness among millions of men
who had fought in the war and now were disillusioned with
the promises made and betrayed by politicians. With so
many men idle—lack of coal would shut down every industry—there
might be a violent conflict. The Government
was prepared to use force. He understood they were
calling out the Army reserves. Some act of hooliganism,
some shot fired accidentally, or otherwise, by any fool,
and frightful things might happen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Supposing the soldiers refuse to fire on their own
crowd?” asked Verney, and something in his eyes showed
his hope for that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was silence in Christy’s room, until Christy himself
broke it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That means Revolution—and the end of England as a
world power.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re not out for Revolution,” said Verney, in a low
voice. “We’re out for a decent rate of wage—nothing more
than that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he raised his voice a little, and it had a thrill in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the Government asks for Revolution, if it arranges
it, the blood guilt will be on its head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram spoke for the first time. He was irritable, because
all this grave discussion had come as a surprise to
him, and suggested unpleasant possibilities which he hadn’t
imagined, and didn’t believe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you think we’d better drop all mention of the
word Revolution? It’s an ugly damn word, and oughtn’t
to be in our English vocabulary. It isn’t in our English
character, if I know England.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The company had been startled by Bertram’s intervention,
all but Christy, who understood his silences and his outbursts,
and the working of his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do any of us know England?” asked Bernard Hall,
after a slight pause. “The men who went out to the war—to
France, Palestine, Egypt, Salonica, Russia—have come
back again. We don’t understand what’s going on in their
minds. They don’t understand themselves. We’re dealing
with uncertain, unknown forces.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know the men pretty well,” said Bertram. “I keep in
touch with them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They paid some heed to that, and admitted his claim to
give evidence, acknowledging their own distance from the
labouring classes, their theoretical guesses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t think they’re out for trouble?” asked Hall.
His dark, Celtic face, with its brooding eyes, was heavily
overcast by the shadow of anxiety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They want peace,” said Bertram, “and enough to eat,
decent house-room, and a little pocket-money for the fun
of things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Bill Huggett who had given him that view of
the situation. He used Huggett as a guide to the mind of
the London crowds, the average mind of the dreary processions
of men, marching with trained step through London
with banners saying, “We want work, not charity,” and the
point of view of the seedy-looking groups lounging about
the Labour Exchanges, and of other assemblies of men
listening on Sunday afternoons to political orators in Hyde
Park. Bill Huggett was his interpreter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man had succeeded in getting back some of his work
as “French polisher.” He was earning about two pounds
ten a week, out of which he paid eighteen shillings for two
miserable rooms in the slums of Walworth. With the rest
he could manage to get food for himself and his four children,
in spite of high prices. Getting back to work had
changed his whole aspect. He was more alert, and less inclined
to “grouse,” and he’d regained some of the old
Cockney humour which had made him popular as a company
sergeant in France and Flanders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram spent half an hour with him, now and again, in
his lodgings, or in a public-house round the corner, and
Hugget, though always embarrassed by this comradeship of
his former officer, and somewhat suspicious of its motives,
was not ungrateful or unfriendly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It amazed him that Bertram seemed pleased to sit in his
dirty little room for a few minutes, not bothering when
the youngest “brat” began a howl in the next room, and
dozens of other children, sickly, ailing, underfed some of
them, joined in a chorus of wailing in this block of “workmen’s
dwellings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Women railed through open or broken windows, looking
into a courtyard filled with “washing”—and threatened
to break the jaws of small children, if they didn’t “be’ave,”
or insulted each other for certain grievances connected with
the water supply on the common stairways. Doors banged,
cheap gramophones blared out jazz tunes. Somewhere a
violin was being scraped like the crying of a soul in agony,
by a diligent practiser of finger-exercises. Shrill laughter
of coarse-voiced girls rang out in the passages. Oaths
floated up from the courtyard. The noise of distant domestic
quarrels came vaguely into Huggett’s room, where he
sat in his shirtsleeves, smoking Woodbine cigarettes and
answering Bertram’s questions with a queer, nervous grin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Omes for ’Eroes!” he remarked once when the strange
medley of noises in the Workmen’s Dwellings became more
than usually discordant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “silver slipper” story upon which Bertram questioned
him, excited his sense of humour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silver my foot!” he said; “white metal at sixpence the
gross! A Bolshevist emblem? Well, if that ain’t the funniest
yarn! Strikes me there’s no more sense in some of
them so-called Toffs than in the long ears of a coster’s
moke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had a realistic mind, and was something of a philosopher,
like others Bertram knew, who had risked their lives
in the war, and escaped by a hairsbreadth chance of luck.
In their billets behind the line, in dug-outs, in shell-holes
where they had lain wounded, these men, or some of them,
had thought starkly of the meaning of things, had talked
with each other in a kind of short-cut language, incoherent,
yet understanding. Now they thought of the Peace they’d
helped to make, and the life they’d come back to find.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s like this, Major. We’re fed up with lies. The
blarsted lies of newspapers. The muck them politicians
say. The rotten stuff some of our own leaders say. In
the old days we used to believe what we was told or what
we read. Now we’ve found out. We’ve been kidded, all
along! That’s made us think. We know a bit of truth
ourselves. We know what ’appened to us. The things we
did. The things we’ve seen. We can’t be kidded any more.
That makes a lot of difference!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do the men want?” asked Bertram. “What are
they looking for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not over much,” said Huggett. “There’s some that
talk a lot. I did a bit myself before I found my job again.
Communism. Bolshevism. Bunkum. More kidding!
Most others are out for peace—no more bloody war, not
at no cost—decent ’ouse-room—not this dog ’ole for eighteen
bob a week—a bit of pocket money for the fun of
things. See?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram thought he saw. He believed that Huggett knew
the truth of things about the spirit of the men. He marvelled
at this fellow’s commonsense, his soundness of judgment,
his sense of humour, his patience. Those had been the
qualities of the men in the war. They were still there. If
all the men were like Huggett, or most of them, England
was safe. The menace was only in the minds of men like
Bernard Hall of <span class='it'>The New World</span>—intellectually morbid—and
in the minds of Joyce’s crowd, who were obsessed by
the bogey of Bolshevism—that strange foreign growth, so
alien to English ideas.</p>

<div><h1>XVIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“Joyce’s crowd!” To some extent his own crowd. He
saw it, not for the first time, but peculiarly defined in
his imagination, and in all its glory, on the afternoon of
Lady Ottery’s lecture. He drove in a “taxi” with Joyce
from their little home in Holland Street to the Wigmore
Hall, and by the time they’d reached Cumberland Place, at
the top of the Park, fell into line with a steady stream of
automobiles of highly expensive kinds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The New Poor aren’t so beastly poor yet,” said Bertram,
thinking of Huggett in his squalid rooms with the
four squalling brats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce tapped his hand sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve saved a little out of the wreckage. Precious
little, and we’re all going ‘broke.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce had two reserved seats towards the front of the
hall. Bertram saw that she wore a new hat for the occasion,
a little blue thing, with an osprey plume (Bernard
Hall would hate her for that!), and the short ermine cloak
which Lady Ottery had given her for “going away,” when
they were married. She looked splendid in health again,
and exquisite to his eyes as she stood up looking round the
hall and smiling to many friends who waved hands to her,
or programmes. The two Russian girls—the Countess
Lydia and her sister—were a few seats behind, and called
out over the heads of other ladies:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So glad you could come, <span class='it'>chérie</span>! Your husband too!
<span class='it'>Merveilleux!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That last sentence was a dig of spite from the Countess
Lydia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How d’you do, Lady Joyce?” This very gallantly and
formally from General Bellasis, who nodded affably to
Joyce’s husband, and said, “Going strong, Pollard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth Murless sauntered in (his arduous duties at the
Foreign Office didn’t prevent afternoon outings of this
kind) looking elegant, as usual, in morning dress with a
white slip beneath his waistcoat, and immaculate spats.
Bertram hated him unendurably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Joyce! Is Lady Ottery in good form? Not
nervous, I hope?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother is never nervous,” said Joyce. “It’s not a family
failing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She held a kind of reception, standing there by her seat,
and Bertram was aware of some extremely pretty girls, and
many ugly old ladies. The old ladies interested him most.
God, how ugly they were! Many of them wore black silk
with beads. He thought such costumes had departed with
Queen Victoria. Others were youthfully dressed in the
latest style, with odd little hats and short capes like Joyce’s,
and low-necked bodices. They were fat and old and hard
and wrinkled. He did not blame them for that—poor old
darlings!—but only observed them. He knew some of them
by sight. He’d had the honour of shaking hands with some
of them—little old hands with many rings—at various receptions
to which Joyce had dragged him. There were two
Dowager Duchesses, like caricatures of themselves by Bolshevik
artists. The Lord alone knew how many Countesses.
The old Régime had rallied up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men were in a minority, but those present were full
of quality—old gentlemen whom one sees in profile deep
sunk in club chairs, white-haired, bald, with bags under
their eyes, with side-whiskers, with hawk noses; and
middle-aged men who, one day, would be the exact replicas
of the old gentlemen, but now straight-backed, with close-cut
hair, firm mouths, alert eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram recognised Lord Banthorp, Viscount Risborough,
the Duke of Berkshire, old Brookwood of Banstead,
Morton of Greystoke, and the new Earl of Winthorp. He
also observed the entry of several Major-Generals and
Brigadiers in “civvies,” as Bill Huggett called his old pre-war
clothes, and not so terrifying as when his machine-gun
company had been reviewed by them before and after battle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His mother-in-law had certainly drawn “a good house.”
It represented the aristocracy of England in its oldest and
crustiest tradition, with only a thin sprinkling, he guessed,
of the newer vintages. The old, ugly ladies had come out
of their hiding-places in Mayfair to support England in
“the hour of danger.” There was something fine about
them, in spite of ugliness, even because of it. He admitted
that. He knew their spirit, indomitable, hard to themselves
as to others, resolute in what they believed to be their duty.
They were the grandmothers of modern girlhood in Joyce’s
crowd, those pretty, laughing, dashing-looking girls, and on
the whole, perhaps, of stronger stuff. Well, perhaps not!
Joyce and her crowd had come out well in the war, with
some scandalous exceptions. His eyes wandered about,
studying the faces in the hall with something like a new
vision—Christy’s angle of vision, Janet Welford’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were beautiful faces there, neither old nor young,
of middle-aged women, rather sad, rather anxious, rather
worn. They were the women who had suffered the strain
of war most in their souls, with long patient agony. The
mothers of fighting men, the wives of others. He could see
in their eyes that they remembered things which he remembered,
which others forget. Among them was the beautiful
Lady Martock, in her widow’s weeds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Duke of Bramshaw led Lady Ottery to her chair on
the platform, and there was a clapping of hands, and a
scuttling to places.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce took her seat, and her face was eager and proud
because of this public tribute to her mother. Her father,
who had come in late, with Alban, sat next to her on her
left hand. His face wore his usual vacant look, with
slightly opened mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your mother’s marvellous!” he said to Joyce in a loud
voice, which she “hushed” immediately, and after that
rebuke, he settled himself deliberately to sleep. He had
heard a good deal at home about the Religion of Revolution.
It was not new to him, and he had acquired the habit
of sleep in the House of Lords and during all speeches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alban, on his father’s left, wonderfully good-looking,
dressed almost as well as Kenneth Murless, kept awake, but
appeared painfully bored. He too, was aware of his
mother’s theory. He avoided it as much as possible, while
agreeing with its general thesis. Out of filial respect and
devotion he had come to-day, at some personal sacrifice in
the way of a game of real tennis at the Bath Club, which
was a passion of his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Duke of Bramshaw opened with some general observations
on the subject of Lady Ottery’s lecture. He was
a thin man, with a long, mournful face, a sharply curved
nose, and a bald head. Caricaturists made him look like
a diseased bird of prey. In the clubs he was generally
known as “the greyhound,” because he made a little hair
go a long way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In melancholy tones he referred to the honour he had
in introducing the Countess of Ottery, who, indeed, needed
no introduction to such an audience as he saw before him,
well aware of her devoted work during the War, of her
great virtue as a wife and mother, of her noble patriotism,
and of her profound scholarship. They were to receive the
benefit of her historical knowledge that afternoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He himself had been a student of history, as far as his duties
in the House of Lords would permit, and other services
which he had been called to do for his King and Country,
but he confessed that he had been amazed by the revelations
which Lady Ottery had discovered in relation to a
continuous tradition of revolutionary doctrine, of a most
subversive, destructive, and damnable kind—if they would
permit him to use so strong a word—from the time of the
Fourteenth Century to the present day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Ottery had made it quite clear to him, he felt sure
that she would make it quite clear to the audience—that the
revolutionary spirit which they found in the world around
them, not only in Russia, but nearer home, in their very
midst, he regretted to say, was due to the dreadful propaganda
of a secret cult, mainly of German-Jewish origin,
which had for its object the overthrow of civilisation, the
downfall of Christian morality, no less than the destruction
of all law and order. The members of that cult, the Initiated,
as they called themselves, were but few, but they were
powerful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Lady Ottery would tell them, they belonged to the
tradition of Satan worship, that dark and evil blasphemy
of the Middle Ages. It was an awful thought that men in
England belonged to that secret brotherhood. They were
working among the labouring classes of England. They
were, he said so with a frankness which the gravity of the
time demanded, endeavouring to promote at that very hour,
a Strike which threatened to paralyse the life and industry
of Great Britain. The Countess of Ottery was not, therefore,
lecturing on an academic theory of history, unrelated
to their present situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In short, my Lords, ladies, and gentlemen, the lecture
we are about to hear is a warning of the menace at our
very doors.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Lady Ottery—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With enormous melancholy he bowed to the applause of
the ugly old ladies and the pretty young ones, and resigned
his place on the platform to Bertram’s Mother-in-law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For Heaven’s sake!” said Bertram, aloud. Sheer rage
was rising in his brain. What did all this mean? Did these
people seriously believe all that dark and monstrous nonsense
suggested by the Duke of Bramshaw? A sentence of
Bill Huggett’s came into his brain. He repeated it to himself,
over and over again, as Lady Ottery began her lecture,
and went on with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no more sense in some of these so-called Toffs
than in the long ears of a coster’s moke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet the Duke of Bramshaw was not a fool. He had
been educated at Eton and Oxford. He had made many
speeches in the House of Lords. He had held high office
during the War. These people were not fools. They were
highly educated. They helped to govern England. Good
Heavens! They were, in their way, among the best types
of English aristocracy. It was impossible for him to believe
that such an audience could listen patiently to such a wild
falsification of history and commonsense as that outlined
by the Duke of Bramshaw, and elaborated by his mother-in-law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce had said, “Do behave, Bertram!” and he “behaved”
while Lady Ottery read page after page of manuscript
in a clear, hard, penetrating voice, perfectly self-possessed,
strikingly handsome, utterly convinced of her
own argument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram tried not to listen to her, but her words penetrated
his brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a kind of insane and dreadful logic she ranged
through centuries of history, connecting the origin of all
revolts, uprisings, passionate outbreaks of peasants—and
peoples—from the Black Death to the French Revolution,
from that to the Chartist Riots, from 1848 to the Liberation
of Italy, from the Veto of the House of Lords to the
Russian Revolution, and from Bolshevism in Russia to
Trade Union strikes in England—to small groups of
fanatical men and women, belonging, as the Duke had said,
to a secret cult pledged to the overthrow of civilisation and
religion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She quoted old documents, newly discovered letters, ancient
memoirs, journals, revolutionary pamphlets, political
allegories and squibs, enormous tomes of German philosophers,
French atheists, Italian free-thinkers, Russian anarchists.
Her range of research, her immense industry, was
wonderful, and she had hewn her pathway of argument with
remarkable skill and clarity through a jungle of false
evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she had entirely ignored the ordinary impulses of
human nature—the savage instincts of men when they and
their women folk are starving while others are fully fed,
the passion of downtrodden peoples for the liberty of life,
the long patience, breaking at last into impatience, of simple
folk oppressed by corrupt and cruel tyrannies, the vision of
a better human life in the minds of those who starve in
garrets and languish over sweated labour, the righteous
wrath of those who see their rulers growing rotten with
luxury and vice, the divine rage at the heart of a people
under the scourge of the knout, and the brutality of a secret
police, the silent, ever-growing pressure of the Nobodies of
the world for more joy in life, a wider margin of ease, a
greater share of luck and opportunity, the claims of men
who have done good service and expect a fair reward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram thought of all the men who had gone marching
with him, and before him, and behind him, up the roads of
war in France and Flanders, the men of England, Scotland,
Ireland, Wales. They had seen the bodies of their “pals”
blown to bits, but had not turned back. They had sat down
with Death, smelt it, heard it scream above their heads,
known the fear of it, seen the close horror of it, day after
day, month after month, year after year, but had not surrendered
some faith in them, some love of their soil, some
heritage of the spirit. Were they now likely to be the
victims of a “secret cult,” urging them to overthrow civilisation?
Were they in dark conspiracy, as the dupes of
German Jews, to play Hell and Satan-worship in the country
they had saved by the valour of their souls? They were
restless, discontented, bitter. What wonder, when prices
were rising high against them, and wages were going down,
and unemployment was creeping up like a dark tide of
misery into millions of little homes? This lecture of Lady
Ottery’s was an outrage to the men who had fought for
England, though she had no idea of that. It was a perversion
of all truth in history. It was putting morbid fears
into the minds of an audience already obsessed by fantastic
bogeys. It would lead to conflict and cruelty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joyce, I can’t bear it. This is mad and monstrous!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he whispered to Joyce, and she turned to him angrily,
and said, “Be quiet, Bertram!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their movement, and Joyce’s answer, awakened the Earl
of Ottery. He smiled sleepily at Joyce, and said her
mother was remarkable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently Bertram rose in his seat, bent again to find his
stick on the floor under some ladies’ muffs, and whispered
again to Joyce:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry, darling! I’m going. I can’t breathe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re abominable!” said Joyce, in a low voice, and
turned her head away from him with an angry shake of her
bobbed hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He strode through an audience that was hostile to his
going. Old Brookwood of Banstead growled audibly as he
passed, “Be quiet, sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Outside, groups of chauffeurs were chatting beside their
motor cars, and across Oxford Circus, as he passed through,
came a procession of unemployed with their banners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We want work!”</p>

<div><h1>XIX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram was staking everything on his book, in spite
of Christy’s “hands-up” and cry of “Kamerad!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was going well,—amazingly well. He was astonished
at the way in which words came to him. After the first
agonies he had found himself writing easily, rapidly. It
was as though he was just the instrument recording the dictation
of some mind beyond himself. In reality, as he
knew, he was drawing upon his memories, and emotions
stirred up in his subconsciousness, repressed for a long
time, and now liberated. He remembered things which, at
the time he hadn’t noticed much, or at all—smells, sounds,
minute particular details of visual impressions. The pictures
of war were as sharply etched in his mind’s eye as
when he stared for the first time across No Man’s Land,
or took his machine-gun up to Fricourt on the Somme and
saw death busy on a day of great battle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was extraordinary how he could reach back to it all,
from this little house in Holland Street, Kensington, within
sound of the London ’busses passing up Church Street.
When Joyce was out or in bed, and he was writing in his
study, alone, late at night, the old life of war came back
to him so vividly, with such intensity, that more than once
when he lifted his head, he was startled to find himself,
not in a dug-out, or leaning over the sand-bags of a trench
parapet—he smelled chloride of lime!—but in his room,
with Joyce’s portrait over the mantelpiece, and peace outside
the windows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here in the manuscript sheets before him, as far as he’d
gone, he had told what war was like. The men who knew
would say, “That’s how it was!” He had paid the tribute
of his soul to Tommy Atkins, who had not been given a
fair deal. The book might do a bit of good. It would pass
on the experience of those who knew the meaning of war
to a generation which wouldn’t know, unless some one told
them. This was worth doing. Perhaps worth living to do.
Had he been spared to live to do it? There might be something
in that. He’d always wondered why he should go
scot free—not a scratch all through the war, with other men
dropping on every side of him. Anyhow, he would try
to pay back for the grace of life—such as it was!—by this
book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the truth, in every line of it, in every word. He
had found the gift of words. That was his buried talent,
now revealed. That was what he’d been searching for, the
meaning of that queer sensation of waiting for something
to happen. This had happened! The gift of words—the
greatest gift in the world, if a man pledged his soul to
truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hoped Joyce would like his book. It would be fine
if she said, “Well done!” when he read it to her. She
would be critical. She would hate some of the things he
had written, brutal, some of them, but she would acknowledge
the truth of it, the bigness of his achievement. For it
was going to be big, with the spirit of the greatest war in
the world, and of England’s manhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was telling it all, nothing left out, nothing shirked, in
horror, courage, boredom, fear, filth, laughter, madness.
Joyce had seen a bit of it in London hospitals. She
wouldn’t funk reading about it, and she would be generous
in praise, if he had written it well, as she was generous to
Kenneth Murless for his snappy sonnets. She would understand
him better after reading it. She would be more patient
with him. And she would see that he was going to
keep his end up, and not sponge on her for everything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a bit of luck the book would make some money.
That would make things easier in married life, and give
him the independence which all men must have. It would
make him less moody and humpy in his temper. Perhaps
it would bring Joyce and him closer again, in the old relations
of love and comradeship, which somehow had been
interrupted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was with this thought in his mind that he gathered up
a bundle of his manuscript and went up to Joyce’s room.
It was the morning after Lady Ottery’s lecture, and Joyce
was still in bed. She had a habit of lying late. Perhaps
she would be inclined to let him read some of his stuff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was absurdly emotional, as all writers with their first
creation. He’d been living with the book. He had staked
his hopes on it. It was his mind-child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce was busy with the papers when he went in and
said, “Good morning, darling!” She murmured a reply of
some kind, and turned over another page of <span class='it'>The Morning
Post</span>, which rustled loudly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram waited for a little while until she might finish
the society news, or whatever it was that she was reading.
She was sitting up in one of her Japanese silks with a ribbon
tied round her hair, and a little frown on her forehead,
like Marjorie Maude in “Peter Pan.” He sat on the bed
by her side and watched her eyes roving over the big
printed sheet. She was reading nothing very important.
Her attention was not fixed on any definite news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve brought my book, as far as it’s gone,” said Bertram
with preposterous nervousness. “Care to hear some, Joyce?
I want your opinion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce didn’t care to hear any of the book. She had something
else in her mind. It was his hostile demonstration at
her Mother’s lecture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You behaved abominably yesterday afternoon,” she said,
ignoring the book altogether. “Even father accused you of
bad form when you walked out like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Lord!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He confessed his contrition, said “Let’s forget it, sweetheart!”
and showed her the mass of manuscript he had
written.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe I’ve done the trick,” he said, with excitement
in his voice. “I’m certain it’s the real thing. Spare me an
hour before lunch and let me read a bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It doesn’t interest me in the very slightest degree,” said
Joyce. “Please go out of my room, and let me get up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If she had struck him in the face with her clenched fist
she couldn’t have hurt him so much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He didn’t understand that he’d come at the worst possible
time for a reading of his book, when Joyce was deeply
mortified by his contempt of her mother’s lecture, and more
annoyed because of his casual regret and “let’s forget it!”
regarding an incident which seemed far from trivial to her.
It was contempt for her, as well as for her mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram’s exasperated comments at the Wigmore Hall
were another revelation of the wide gulf between her ideas
and his. He was drawing further and further away from
all the loyalties which she believed were the essential faith
of an English gentleman, one of her class, one of those who
stood for the things which belonged to her family and creed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had been irritated from the beginning by that book
of his. It was ridiculous to think that Bertram could write!
He had none of the brilliance of Kenneth Murless, and had
shown himself plainly bored by the conversation of her
friends on books and poetry. Even on that subject he had
been hostile to their ideas, and had denounced the work of
people like Stephen McKenna and W. L. George with contemptuous
words as “unreal stuff.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That book he was writing had been a cause of secret
irritation in her mind. He had preferred it to her company.
He had deliberately isolated himself in its scrawled
sheets, instead of joining her little parties, and making himself
agreeable to her crowd. The book had been a barrier
between them. It had made him careless of getting a decent
job. It had caused him to brood over the beastly war while
she wanted him to forget it. He was probing the old
wounds again, deliberately intensifying his morbid outlook
on life. She guessed it was filled with his bitter, democratic,
anti-class views, which seemed to her like treachery
to England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And anyhow, he wanted to read it to her at the very hour
when she was going to have her hair curled by the girl
from Truelove’s who was due at ten o’clock! Really Bertram
was exasperating!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps that was what she had been thinking. Bertram
worked it out in that way afterwards, some time afterwards,
when he tried to analyse the reason for Joyce’s unkindness.
Because it was unkind—damnably. It took all the grit out
of him in its immediate effect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Knocked all the stuffing out of him, as he put it to himself
when he went downstairs again, flung his manuscript
on the desk, and said “Hell!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hadn’t argued with her, just said, “Sorry I bothered
you!” and then turned on his heel and went out of his
wife’s room. He passed the girl from Truelove’s on the
stairs, and thought bitterly that Joyce was more interested
in her hair than in his book.</p>

<div><h1>XX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>It was not to Joyce that he read out his book when it
was quite finished, but to Janet Rockingham Welford,
author of “Mixed Marriages,” “The Surplus Virgins,” and
other alarming works. With her usual desire for information,
her habit of asking the most searching and intimate
questions, she had gained his admission some time ago that
he was no longer searching for a “job” because he had
found his object in life—this book on the war, and the gift
of words. He didn’t call it a “gift” to her. He called it
his new obsession, and was pleased with her excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was vastly excited. She vowed that she had seen
“in the blink of an eyelid” that he had something to tell the
world that the world should know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be timid!” was her advice. She urged him to be
brutal, to tell the truth in its starkness. She hated those
little scribblers who still covered the filth of war with rose-water,
concealing its stench. She wanted Bertram to be
cruel to himself and to his readers, not to spare them a jot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make their nerves jump,” she said. “Take them by
the scruff of the neck and thrust their noses into the horror,
and say, ‘Look at this! That’s what it’s like! And this
is what it’s going to be again, to your little snub-nosed boys,
to your annoying but necessary husbands, to your best beloved,
unless you’re jolly careful.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram said that was his idea. He’d been honest, anyhow.
Not brutal for literary effect, but true to the things
he’d seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet wasn’t satisfied with that. She wanted him to be
true to the things he’d felt as well as seen. She wanted him
to remember his own agony in the worst hours, to get into
his book all the agony of all the men, blinded, crippled,
shell-shocked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make it a masterpiece!” she implored. “Write it to
revenge my blinded men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram told her she expected too much, and warned
her that he was only a beginner at the writing game. He
needed criticism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll get it, little one!” promised Janet Welford.
“Read it out to me, and I’ll make your flesh quail if you
haven’t been honest with yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was her invitation, and he accepted it with the sensitive,
wistful, urgent desire of all beginners in the art of
Literature not for criticism—which is terrible to suffer—but
for encouragement, interest, understanding, praise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Night after night he went round after dinner to Janet’s
flat in Overstrand Mansions, Battersea Park, one of a long
line of tall blocks of dwellings mostly inhabited as Bertram
found, by the poorer “Intellectuals,” the “Surplus Virgins”
(as Janet called her own class of unmarried women), and
newly-wed couples on modest means, with room for one
perambulator in the little “hall.” Some novelist had once
written a book about this street, called “Intellectual Mansions,
S.W.,” and the name had stuck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She barred out all other visitors until the reading was
finished, by the simple plan of putting an envelope under
the door knocker with an inscription in her big, bold handwriting,
“Out of Town.” Several times as he read, Bertram
heard footsteps faltering on the landing outside, and
then going down the stone staircase again, dejectedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor wretches!” he would say, and Janet would light
another cigarette, or puff out a wreath of smoke, and say,
“Absence makes the heart grow fonder! Get on with it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was helpful to him. She didn’t spare criticism. She
made him “quail” all right! She found mistakes in grammar,
split infinitives, frightful faults in style. She cried
out at such times as though he’d touched her with a red-hot
poker: “Oh, my little sensitive soul!”—“Oh, my æsthetic
Aunt!”—“Oh, ignorant and nerve-shattering soldier-man!”
Such absurdities of ejaculation warned him of dreadful
blunders, which then she corrected like a stern “schoolmarm,”
so comical in her caricature that Bertram laughed
while he quailed. A hundred times she stormed at him
because he’d “shirked” the uttermost reality, turning away
with cowardice from the obscenity of war’s torture-chambers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stronger!” she would say. “Stronger! That’s weak.
Let the Truth come right out and show its bloody face to
those who still believe in the glory and splendour of war’s
adventure—the romantic women, crudest in all the world,
the hundred per cent patriots who would engage in world
war for a nice point of honour or to avenge a pin-prick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were times when Bertram felt the cold chill of
failure on him. This book, then, was no good! He had
failed! He had fooled himself into the belief that it was
the Real Thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But these moods did not overwhelm him, because of
Janet’s emotion, rage, laughter, tears, as he went on reading.
She loved what he had written about the men. She
knew them. She had nursed them. They had wept out of
blind eyes in her arms. They had “groused” and cursed
and laughed and joked and agonised, and revealed nakedly
the secret of their souls to her. She knew, and Bertram
had written what she knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After each reading he asked her anxiously for her
opinion. Was it any good? Did it have the slightest
chance? He wanted her to tell him frankly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She teased him a little. She said: “I reserve judgment,”
or “I’ve read worse stuff,” and then when he was tortured
by doubt, she laughed in her full-throated way, and told
him to be conceited because she wasted so much time upon
him. Christy would be jealous of him, if he ever knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Christy jealous?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her searchingly, to see how much truth
there might be in that, but he could not guess the meaning
of the whimsical look in her eyes, nor of the sudden blush
that flamed into her cheeks after those careless words of
hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the reading of the last chapter, he asked his usual
question: What did she think? Any good? Or had he
wasted his time, and his hopes?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not answer for a little while, and then suddenly
took both his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s good! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Not all the truth, but all true.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A
good book, soldier man, and almost great! Thank God,
you’ve written it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These words warmed his soul. He was enormously grateful
for them. A wave of emotion swept over him because
this praise, so simply spoken, so generously, by this girl
who understood, was a reward for his labour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He raised her hands to his lips, and kissed them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whatever happens to the book,” he said, “your sympathy
and help have been tremendous to me. How can I
pay back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She let her hands linger in his, not deliberately, but carelessly.
She laughed at his suggestion of “paying back,”
and called him by the absurd nickname which she had invented
for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No fee, Sir Faithful! I’ll be satisfied for service done
when you abandon the Halfway House and come over to
the Left Wing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not likely!” answered Bertram. “I walk in the middle
of the road.”</p>

<div><h1>XXI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>After that reading of the book, there wasn’t the same
excuse for Bertram to go to Janet’s flat in Battersea.
Not the same reason. Yet he went. The truth was, as he
admitted, that he could not keep away because he craved
for the laughter, the audacity of thought, and the free comradeship
which he found with Janet and her friends, and
not in his own house. Decidedly not in his own house in
the week or two that followed Lady Ottery’s lecture and
Joyce’s refusal to interest herself in his work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even Edith, the parlourmaid, showed by various little
signs of sympathy meant in a kind spirit, but frightfully
embarrassing, that she was aware of Joyce’s unkindness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t you going with her ladyship to-night, sir?” Or,
“Seems a pity you don’t like cards. Her ladyship is that
fond of Bridge!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Deliberately Joyce involved herself in a series of bridge
parties which ignored Bertram’s claim to companionship
and included, every time, it seemed, Kenneth Murless or
General Bellasis, generally in the rooms of the Countess
Lydia in Whitehall Court. Now that his book was finished,
and in Christy’s hands for professional advice about the
way to get it published, Bertram felt loneliness closing
about him with a greater chill. Sometimes he thought
Joyce was teasing his jealousy. She talked of Kenneth in
terms of affectionate comradeship, and then glanced at Bertram
to see whether she had piqued him. She confessed
that she owed Kenneth a good deal of money for Bridge
debts—“but of course he could wait.” Kenneth had been
in particularly good form that night. His stories about
Lady Speelman’s ball had made everybody laugh. She was
going to the Opera with Kenneth and the Russian girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram didn’t disguise his feelings, but he restrained the
expression of his temper. Something had happened in him
worse than ill-temper. It was a coldness that was creeping
into his heart, a sense of some complete and terrible misunderstanding
between Joyce and himself, beyond all petty
quarrels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had a dreadful apprehension that something in the
very quality of his character was alien, offensive, and intolerable
to the fastidious and delicate mind of his young wife.
Perhaps he was of a coarser fibre than she was. He was
afraid the war had brutalised him more than he was aware
of. He had certainly “learnt to swear abominably in
Flanders,” like English soldiers of Smollett’s time, and his
nerves had been frayed so badly that he didn’t always check
his tongue in the presence of Joyce. But it was deeper than
that, and worse than that. Joyce seemed to find him a
vulgarian, a common fellow. There were times when her
eyes seemed to say so.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet Welford did not make him feel like that. She
called him “Sir Faithful,” and once “did homage to him,”
so she pretended, in her jolly way, as “a very parfit gentil
knight.” By that name she introduced him to her friends,
those queer, free-spoken, amazingly audacious girls who
seemed to be the advance guard of Social revolution in
England, and played intellectual games of skittles with the
old traditions of English life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat dumb among them at times because of their wild
talk. They were pretty Bolshevists, who frightened him
with their revolutionary ideals. The Russian experiment
had not been revealed yet in all its ghastly failure, and they
spoke lightly of Lenin as “the Master-mind,” and had a
sentimental affection for Trotsky as “the new Napoleon,”
and refused to believe a word of the atrocity stories manufactured,
so they said, by propagandists of the White
Armies at Riga and Helsingfors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram wondered what would happen to his exalted
Mother-in-law, if she were suddenly to be transported from
Holme Ottery to that flat in Battersea Park, and heard such
discourse. He wondered what would happen to himself, if
she saw him there, surrounded by these pretty witches. Not
pretty all of them! Janet’s best friend, Katherine Wild,
was a snub-nosed woman, with short hair cut like a man’s,
but with courage and comedy in her grey eyes. She and
Janet made the pace in conversation, egged each other on
to new extravagances, made one great jest of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was but verbal flippancy. Bertram remembered Janet’s
devotion to the blinded soldiers of St. Dunstan’s. From
Janet he knew that Katherine Wild devoted all her life to
the starving children of the devastated countries in Europe,
as the organiser of relief. She had been working in the
soup kitchens of Vienna, and knew, as few others, the agony
of Austria. It was the knowledge of life’s tragedy that
made her seize at any of life’s jokes, and make a religion
of laughter. Her great hope was to get into Russia and to
extend the work of relief to that country, which was still
blockaded by the rest of Europe because of the menace and
fear of Bolshevism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shan’t have seen the depths of human misery,” she said
once, “until I’ve crossed the frontier into Russia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you want to see the depths?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The uttermost depths. Until then my knowledge of life
won’t be complete. You must go there too, Mr. Pollard!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She told him that Janet had spoken to her about his book
on the war. The last chapter couldn’t be written until he’d
been to Russia. There was the aftermath of Armageddon.
After War, Famine, and after Famine, Pestilence. The
Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse had ridden through
Russia, and the noise of their hoofs could be heard in Western
Europe, coming closer, closer. In Russia Europe might
read the writing on the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the key to the riddle of the New World,” she said.
“By what happens in Russia, and the world’s reaction
thereto, we shall know our fate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Strange how he could never escape from talk about
Russia! In Joyce’s crowd he had listened constantly to tales
of Red Army atrocities, the sufferings of the old régime.
In this crowd he listened to denunciations of White Army
cruelties, and the sufferings of Russian peasants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once he lost his temper, and flared out into violent speech
which might have forfeited him the friendship of Janet
Welford, if she had not been enormously broad-minded,
with an all-embracing sense of humour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With her women friends he could be patient, whatever
they said, for they had a sincerity of idealism which was
proved honestly by service in some human way, with sick
children, or suffering men, as nurses, guardians of the poor,
workers in University settlements, guides to blinded soldiers.
But some of Janet’s men friends seemed to him
poisonous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were members, mostly, of that club, “The Left
Wing,” into which she had desired, vainly, to beguile him.
But he saw the types in her rooms, and didn’t like the look
of them. They were egoists, conceited with their own
superior “idealism,” <span class='it'>poseurs</span> of rebel philosophy, amateur
Jacobins, without passion or sincerity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two of them were young men who had escaped service
in the war by going to prison as Pacifists. No doubt that
needed greater moral courage in a way than surrendering
to the general tide of emotion and faith by getting into
khaki. Theoretically he admitted the right, even the nobility
of men who for conscience’ sake, religious belief or
spiritual abhorrence of war—like the Quakers—dared public
contumely by refusing services at such a time. It was
contrary to his own convictions, for though he hated war,
and knew its insanity, he believed that when once a people
had become involved, they must stand in defence of their
own country and of their own homes. Still, he understood
the reasoning of men morally and utterly convinced of the
Christian command, “Thou shalt not kill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But these young men who came to Janet’s flat had been
Pacifists when their country was threatened, and now were
revolutionists, talking very glibly of Lenin’s right to destroy
the enemies of Russian liberty, and of the glorious prospect
of a world revolution for the overthrow of the Capitalist
system.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a young man named Lucas Melvin who aroused
Bertram’s rage. Talking in the affected accent of Christchurch,
at its worst, and playing with a silk handkerchief
which he had drawn from his shirt cuff, he proclaimed his
belief that Labour was about to overthrow the Government
by “direct action.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This coming strike,” he said, “will lead to a general
paralysis of industry. All the Trade Unions will unite for
general action. I anticipate the pleasure of seeing a number
of Profiteers and <span class='it'>bourgeois</span> hanging on the lamp-posts in
Whitehall. <span class='it'>Vive la Révolution Anglaise!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This speech was received with laughter and applause, and
the company was surprised when Bertram rose slowly from
his low chair by the fireside, and stood with his back to
the mantelpiece, glowering at Lucas Melvin, as though preparing
to knock him down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t pass that!” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pass what, dear sir?” asked Melvin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That damned, insincere, and dangerous nonsense of
yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Melvin protested that he didn’t like those coarse words.
He also objected to Bertram’s method of argument. It was
neither elegant nor polite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not so coarse as revolution,” said Bertram, bitterly.
“It’s more polite than a revolutionary mob would be, if
they caught you with a silk handkerchief up your sleeve.
Don’t you realise that if you and other young fools who
play about with the revolutionary idea were ever to find
yourselves in that state of things, your necks would be
wrung first by a mob that’s not out for elegance? They’d
just wipe you out like midges. Don’t you understand that
if England were to go in for revolution, all Europe would
be dragged down with her, and war would be child’s play
to that anarchy and horror?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see you belong to the reactionary set,” said Melvin,
with an air of bravado, but his voice was not quite steady.
“Doubtless you uphold the principles of <span class='it'>The Morning
Post</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I try to see things with commonsense,” said Bertram,
“not like a child, ignorant of realities. I’ve seen war. I
don’t want to see revolution. I imagine it’s worse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Janet who poured oil on the troubled waters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir Faithful,” she said, “verily you speak the words of
truth and wisdom. This child has been well rated. But
of your mercy, remember that this is a bower of fair ladies,
and not a tilting-ground for angry knights.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry!” he said, and his rage died down. Lucas Melvin
retired hurt, and soon the others went, leaving him last,
and alone with Janet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I behaved like a ‘muddied oaf,’ ” he said. “Do you
forgive me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She forgave him so well that she sat on the floor by his
side with her hands clasping her knees, talking about the
queer complexities of life, the muddle in human nature, the
mixed motives of men and women. Presently she told him
that he had better go home. It was unfair to his wife to
stay so late.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joyce won’t be back yet,” he said, “and I hate going
home to a lonely house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked up into his face searchingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid your married life is not all it should be.
Whose fault?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mine,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She told him that if he weren’t so beastly timid, she
would get down to the secret of the trouble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to help,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re helping,” he told her, and then something seemed
to warn him that this was not playing the game by Joyce,
and that he was losing hold of the loyalties to which his
soul was pledged. Janet was helping him too much. In a
little while he might not be able to live without her help,
her sympathy, her understanding, her comradeship. A sudden
movement he made, drawing back from her a little, surprised
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter, Faithful?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d better go. After all, it’s getting late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was only ten o’clock, and not too late for a visit
from Christy. The maid had let him into the hall, and they
hadn’t heard him enter, and were not aware of him until
he came into the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo!” he said. “Where’s all the party?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Faithful broke it up, with violence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet rose from her seat on the floor by Bertram’s side
and held her hand out to Christy like a Princess. He kissed
it with warmth, and said, “The Ugly Beast pays homage
to Divine Beauty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The handsome Megatherium to the beautiful Pterodactyl!”
said Janet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were acting in the usual way, but Bertram was
aware of some state of tension in the room. Christy was
not quite at his ease, nor Janet quite natural.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going so soon?” asked Christy, as Bertram went towards
the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been trying to go for half an hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then stay not on the order of your going, but go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy laughed at the old quotation spoken by Janet,
but Bertram saw a queer look in his eyes, of shyness or
distress. Was old Christy jealous of him, because of his
comradeship with Janet?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ridiculous!</p>

<div><h1>XXII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Christy’s criticism of Bertram’s book was not devastating.
He suggested merely the elimination of certain
passages which seemed to him libellous against a certain
General, and said simply, “You can’t afford a law
suit,” when Bertram protested violently that he intended
to libel the old scoundrel, but hadn’t been half strong
enough in his character study of a blood-thirsty Junker,
ruthless of men’s lives. His praise was limited to a few
words, but magnificent to a man who knew him as Bertram
did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can write. You know the right words.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was good enough from Christy, hard critic, and
honest as death. He asked Bertram to let him send the
book to Heatherdew, the literary agent, and his friend.
He would find a publisher, if any man could, and take a
personal interest in it, as a hater of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram wanted to know how many weeks he would
have to wait before the book appeared, and what payment
he was likely to get, an impatience which amused Christy,
who had more experience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It can’t be out till the autumn, at earliest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not till the autumn! Good Heavens!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not accepted yet, old man. Hang on to patience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He conveyed a suggestion to Bertram from Bernard
Hall of <span class='it'>The New World</span>. Why not write an article, dealing
generally with the threatened strike? Hall suggested a
title: “The Mind of the Men,” on the lines of Bertram’s
talk about the Comrades of the Great War and their point
of view. What Bill Huggett had told him, and so on. It
would be a valuable contribution, with knowledge at first
hand, not easy to get.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have a shot,” said Bertram. “Do you think the
strike is likely?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Inevitable, I’m told. Nat Verney knows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some time Christy discussed the possibilities of
trouble. The Government seemed to be asking for it. It
was true about calling out the Army Reserves. They also
proposed to recruit the Middle Classes for self-defence.
That would divide England into the Haves and the Have-nots.
A short-sighted policy at such a time, when all such
clear-cut distinctions ought to be avoided. Big Business,
with the Government in league with it, was out to smash
organised Labour. The plan was to defeat it in sections,
first the miners, then the railway men, then the engineers,
then the other great trades. It was to be a general campaign
to bring down wages to pre-war rates. A sound
policy, if prices came down to the same level, but there
was about as much chance of that as of friendship between
France and Germany!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Low wages and sweated labour! That’s the watch-word
now. No ‘Homes for Heroes,’ and other fine cries
which went very well in war-time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram thought it was unfair to the men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a damned outrage!” said Christy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some time the two friends were silent. They knew
each other well enough for long silences. Christy’s cheap
clock on the mantelpiece ticked with a little staccato tattoo.
They did not trouble to switch on the light, but sat smoking
in low chairs on each side of the fire-grate in which a few
coals burned in a heap of white ash. Christy drew hard
at his pipe now and then, and a little red glow lit up his
long, lean face with its deep sunken eyes and bulging forehead.
Down below, in Adelphi Terrace, or its neighbourhood,
some ex-soldier was playing a one-string fiddle, not
badly, but with long-drawn melancholy. Cavalleria Rusticana—they
all played that. Down the Thames, beyond
the Tower Bridge, no doubt, a steamer was sounding its
siren. The Batavia boat, off to Holland, or a river tug
moving. The murmur of London, the voice of its enormous
life and traffic, made the windows throb, and above its
low-toned rhythm, the horns of motor-taxis bleated incessantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy stirred, and poked the dying fire with his boot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to see how this strike works out. I want to be
in England if there’s any real trouble. But I’m off again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Already!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram was distressed. He hung on to Christy’s comradeship.
Here, in these rooms, was a sanctuary into
which he could take refuge from the worries of life, or at
least could ease them, by unloading his pack awhile, and
sorting it out with old Christy. It was not so much
Christy’s words which helped him, but his presence. They’d
been together in dirty places during the war. They had
sat in the same mud-holes, listening to shells overhead, and
expecting death together. They knew each other’s courage
and fears. Christy had wept once, when his <span class='it'>moral</span> had
broken for a while. He had just cried like a child when
the sergeant was blown to bits, not because of any love
for the sergeant, but because of the beastliness and unending
misery of it all. Bertram had been on the verge of
shell-shock once. He was afraid of being afraid. Supposing
he let down the men, played the coward, or something?
Christy had strengthened him then. They knew
each other—in weakness as well as in strength. He hated
to think of Christy going away again so soon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where now?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Berlin for a start. Then—perhaps Moscow. I’ve asked
for permits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Moscow!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy grinned, and confessed it sounded like asking for
the tiger’s cage to be opened. But he wanted to get into
Russia, and <span class='it'>The New World</span> had asked him to go. It
was impossible to find out the truth of what was happening
there. Everything one read was a manufactured lie.
He wanted to know the truth. He would be restless until
he found out. Was there anything at all to be said for the
Russian experiment—Communism? It was no good talking
about Bolshevik atrocities. They weren’t Communism.
He wasn’t sure of them, anyhow, but if they’d happened,
they belonged to the realm of that murder mania which
overtakes people in times of war and revolution. He
wanted to see how the system worked, whether it was any
solution of Capitalist civilisation. It was absurd to pretend
that Western civilisation was the last word in human
wisdom and scientific organisation. The profiteer was in
himself a denial of that! Perhaps, with all their blunderings
and cruelties, Lenin and his crowd had caught hold of
some sound idea. Perhaps it was the beginning of a new
era in social history. He wanted to see for himself, to
know. He had no preconceived ideas. He was out for
the truth, whatever it might be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid you’ll go Bolshevik!” said Bertram. “If you
do, our friendship ends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke the last words lightly, but not without sincerity
and fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll let you know,” said Christy. “A post card will do.
‘I’ve gone Bolshy.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed at the thought of the postcard travelling
from Moscow with its awful message to the outer world.
Probably the censor would seize it. It would be burnt at
the end of a pair of tongs, lest it should spread sedition.
Bertram’s world would never know. At some future date
he might hear of his former friend leading a Red Army
against Poland, or sitting with a long white beard, like
Karl Marx, in the Kremlin, ruling Russia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was some minutes later when Bertram asked a question
sharply:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you told Janet Welford?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy poked the fire, and put it out, with great deliberation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Christy, old man,” said Bertram presently, “is there anything
between you and Janet—I mean in the way of love
and that sort of thing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy laughed, and rose to look at himself in the glass,
and laughed again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With this ugly mug? Does the Neanderthal Man indulge
in amorous dalliance with beautiful women of the
Georgian era? What a horrible thought!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She loves you this side idolatry,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy suddenly flamed out in anger, and it was the first
time Bertram had ever seen him lose control.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn you, Pollard! Why can’t you leave that subject
alone? What right have you to talk of Janet at all? She
used to come here often before you spent all your evenings
in her rooms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram was astounded and overwhelmed by this sudden
outburst. So Christy <span class='it'>was</span> jealous of him! Christy—of
all men in the world!—whom he would no more hurt
than cut off his own right hand!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went over to him, and grabbed his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, you silly old ass! Do you think I wanted to
barge in between you and Janet? What about Joyce, and
my loyalty to her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy’s gust of rage died down as quickly as it had
risen, and he was pale and ashamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry, Pollard! Fact is, you touched the wrong nerve.
I love that girl Janet like an infatuated Romeo. She sets
my frog’s blood on fire. That’s one reason I’m off to Moscow.
Running away!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why run?” asked Bertram. “Why not tell her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy gave another whimsical look at his face in the
mirror over the mantelpiece.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in that mug, laddie! Besides—now we’re talking—I’ve
got a wife, too, don’t you see, although I don’t live
with her? And anyhow, this damned old world of ours
don’t lend itself to love-making just now. It’s falling into
ruin, and I’m busy watching it. The human equation
doesn’t seem to matter, and the ghosts of dead boys, who
were robbed of life before their time, mock at my senile
passion. I ought to know better at my time of life. I’ll
be forty-five in Moscow!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made only one other reference to the subject. It
was when Bertram left his rooms that night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Referring back,” he said, “I might say a parting word,
laddie. If you’re not cut out for disloyalty—and it needs
a special temperament—cut and run when loyalty’s over-strained.
It’s the safest way.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And Moscow is an interesting
place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They gripped hands and wished each other luck. Luck
to the book. Luck to the adventure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dashed funny thing—life,” said Christy, leaning over
the staircase as Bertram went down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all very difficult!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They both laughed. They had spoken the same words a
thousand times in France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All very difficult! Yes. Bertram, going home, wondered
whether Janet Welford had more than a whimsical affection
for Christy. How old Christy had fired up! He
never suspected him of passion—and at forty-five! Time
for the fires to burn out.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He also wondered whether
Joyce understood the meaning of love. Something would
have to be done to make her understand, or his life, and
hers, would be utterly spoilt.</p>

<div><h1>XXIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram had just read his first newspaper article,
entitled “The Mind of the Men”—Bernard Hall’s title—in
that week’s issue of <span class='it'>The New World</span>, when he heard
his name called from the next room by Joyce. There was a
note of emotion in the sound of that call, and he went to her
quickly, wondering if she had hurt herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was standing by the side of her writing desk, holding
an illustrated paper—<span class='it'>Country Life</span>—with a look of
amazement and alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter, Joyce?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pointed to a photograph, and said, “It can’t be true!”
He saw at a glance that it was a view of Holme Ottery
from the west wing, with its stone, ivy-covered terraces,
and broad flight of steps leading down to the tennis lawn
and rose-garden. It was just there, coming up from the
tennis court, that he had heard of Rudy’s death, when Ottery
had handed the telegram to his wife, fingering his red
beard and staring across the grounds with watery eyes.
There was the Venus with her broken nose, and the copy
of the Goose Boy of Pompeii.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Holme Ottery,” said Bertram. “Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was always being photographed for the magazines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce pointed to some words above the picture, and said,
“Can’t you see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words were—“Historic House for Sale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Holme Ottery for sale? No, impossible! It had been
in the Bellairs family for four hundred years or more.
It was a part of English history. Its beauty, its tradition,
its ghosts, its very soil, belonged to the spirit of the family
that had played some part, not insignificant, in the making
of England—as soldiers, courtiers, statesmen. It was
Alban Bellairs, Earl of Ottery, who had been one of Elizabeth’s
favourites before he died with Essex on the scaffold.
Rupert Bellairs, fifth Earl, had been an exile in
Holland with Charles II., and afterwards Master of the
Horse at Whitehall. Joyce Bellairs, the great-great-grandmother
of this Joyce, was the famous beauty to whom
Steele wrote some of his sonnets. Holme Ottery was in
the history books. It meant all that and more to this girl,
his wife. Every fibre of her body belonged to that heritage.
The tradition of her house was the corner-stone of
her own spirit. In pride and faith she was a Bellairs of
Ottery, this girl whom he—a young officer “without a
bean”—had married when War had broken down for a
time the strongest thing in English life, which was caste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some mistake—” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce was weeping passionately. He had never seen her
weep before, and it hurt him poignantly. He put his arms
about her, trying to say words of comfort, but she shook
herself away from him, and paced up and down the room
like an angry boy. It was anger which dried her tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father’s done this without saying a word to me! Even
Mother hasn’t written! It’s treachery to the whole family.
I won’t allow it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram was silent. He remembered what his father-in-law
had said to him outside the House of Lords—something
about Holme Ottery bleeding him to death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think Alban knows?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the eldest son, Bellairs must have been consulted,
must have given his consent to sell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alban is weak as water! Father may have talked him
over. I’ll go down this very day, and let ’em know what <span class='it'>I</span>
have to say on the subject!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later she rang the bell, and told Edith to pack her bag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll come with you,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce didn’t seem to think there was any need for him
to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a family affair,” she said, coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A family affair? Oh, yes, he was outside the family.
Merely the insignificant husband of a Bellairs. His voice
would have no weight in the family councils. He was just
a damned outsider, tolerated as an unfortunate <span class='it'>mésalliance</span>—Joyce’s
mistake. Perhaps Joyce guessed a little at those
thoughts of his, as he stood silent, with flushed face, raging
inwardly at the humiliation which her words made him
feel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t want to drag you into a family row,” she said.
“But you’d better come, after all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in his mind to say that he would be damned if he
went, that he had no intention of being patronised by the
supercilious Alban, his detestable brother-in-law, or bullied
by Lady Ottery, his exalted Mother-in-law. But the sight
of Joyce’s tear-stained face restrained him. The news that
Holme Ottery was up for sale was a blow at her heart, as
he could see by her unusual pallor. He would be a cad to
quarrel with her now, and thrust his own personality forward
in the family tragedy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she went upstairs, he turned over the pages of
<span class='it'>Country Life</span>. Holme Ottery was not the only house for
sale, as well he knew. Page after page was filled with the
usual announcements of “Noble Estates,” “Fine Old Country
Mansions,” “Historic Residences.” Some of them belonged
to people he knew, as he had seen many times
before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He remembered other words spoken by Lord Ottery.
“Our day is done,” he’d said. “The War and its costs have
finished us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These advertisements were only one more proof of the
change that was happening in England, where the Old Order
was gassing, giving place to—what?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was no new revelation to him. He’d seen the boards
up outside many old houses. Some of his own friends had
abandoned their old places and come to live in the Albany,
Belgravia, Knightsbridge, the Kensingtons, and other districts
not immensely far from Mayfair, but outside its
former sanctuary, now delivered over to the New Rich.
They were not distressingly poor. They were carrying on
rather well! But they’d lost the family roof-trees,
the quiet parklands, something of their state in England.
Profiteers, American millionaires, Jews, were taking
over some of the old houses, though many remained unsold.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
This news about Holme Ottery for sale brought
sharply home to Bertram that silent, social, bloodless revolution
which was happening in England. Well, it didn’t
matter very much to him. It mattered very much to Joyce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was silent going down in the train to Sussex, and
seemed to have a chill. He wrapped his overcoat about
her in the corner of the first-class carriage where she sat
smoking cigarettes through a long amber tube. She wore
her country clothes of rough tweed, and looked, he thought,
“patrician” to her polished finger-tips. But amazingly
young, and child-like, in a white Tam-o’-shanter, with a
gleam of gold where her bobbed hair curled above her
neck. He would have liked to kiss her neck, so delicate
and white, so inviting, as she bent her head over the morning
paper. He sat close to her for a while, and put his
arm about her waist, which she suffered impatiently, until
she asked him to give her elbow room and not to get into
one of his “soppy moods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That sent him to the other side of the carriage, moodily,
and he sat staring out of the train at the passing meadows,
all silver and gold and green, on this day of Eastertide.
The sunlight of an April sky chased across the thatched
roofs of little old cottages, touched their tall twisted chimneys,
gleamed on church spires, chased the shadows in
feathery woods. Little old England! So snug, and ancient,
and sheltered, and peaceful. He’d only learnt to love England
properly when he was out of it, fighting for it,—with
only a thin chance of getting back to it. Ireland was
his father’s country, his own birthplace. England was his
mother’s land, and it was England, not Ireland to which
his soul gave allegiance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lying in the earth of France, he had thought back to
England, yearned for it. Not only and always for London,
its mighty heart, which he’d loved, but for the smell of
fields like this, for the sight again—once again—of an old
village like one of those, with a square church tower, and
walled gardens, and orchards white, as now, with blossom.
He had tried to get something of that into his book—the inarticulate,
half-conscious love of England which had come
to country boys, Cockneys, young louts in khaki, so that
some instinct in them, some strain of blood, some heritage
of spirit, had steeled them to stand fast in the dirty ditches
of death, whatever their fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps in a few days the safety of England would be
threatened again by social conflict. As the train crawled
slowly through Robertsbridge, he saw the newspaper placards,
“Strike Certain. Notices Issued.” Bad, that. Perhaps
the railways might close down. They’d have to
motor back from Holme Ottery. Christy had just got
away in time. He wondered if his article on “The Mind
of the Men” would attract any kind of notice. It might
do some good. He’d been fair to the men, tried to make
people understand their point of view, their reasonable
claim for a living wage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce spoke for the first time from her corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to give father hell. He ought to have consulted
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram suggested that perhaps his father-in-law had
wanted to save her from the worry of it, while she was
unwell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense!” she said, impatiently. “It was just cowardice.
He hadn’t the pluck to tell me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Probably Joyce was right. So Bertram thought when
they met Lord Ottery, beyond the lodge gates, strolling towards
them, with a little white dog at his heels. He’d come
to meet his daughter in answer to a telegram she had sent
from Victoria station.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Joyce!” he said, holding out his hairy cheek for
her to kiss. “Glad to see you looking so strong again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was obviously ill at ease. He pretended not to be
aware that Joyce had failed to kiss him, and that her
answer of “Well, father!” to his “Well, Joyce,” was decidedly
hostile and challenging.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your Mother’s not very bobbish this morning,” he
said. “Sick headache, or something of the sort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not surprised,” answered Joyce, with a little sarcastic
laugh which plainly suggested that Lord Ottery was
the cause of her mother’s ill-health. She walked with a
long, swinging stride up the avenue of elms which led
towards the old house, so that her father lagged a little behind
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He remarked that the crops were coming along well, in
spite of the dry weather. He also expressed annoyance because
the villagers had been breaking down some of the
fences on the south side of the park.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The spirit of Bolshevism,” he said. “All those young
fellows back from the war are socialists and lawbreakers.
I can’t understand it. They weren’t like that after the
South African War.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce continued walking in silence. Bertram, stealing a
glance at her, saw that there was a bright spot of colour
on each cheek—danger signals. It was when she reached
the lawns outside the house, and saw its old grey walls
and mullion windows close to the terrace, and the sloping
banks with their clipped hedges, that she turned on her
father and revealed her anger and her anguish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father! I can’t believe it’s true! You couldn’t bring
yourself to do it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do what, my dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lord Ottery put on his vacant look, and opened his
mouth a little, like a stupid rustic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put the house up for sale!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, the house! Oh, Lord! Who told you that? <span class='it'>Have</span>
they put it up for sale? I’ve seen nothing about it in the
Press.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce clutched her father’s arm, and shook him a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father! Tell me the truth. You’re not going to sell
Holme Ottery?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sell it, my dear? Who would buy it? It’s most unlikely
that any one in the world would buy it. It costs a
fearful lot of money to keep up. Look at it now—going
to rack and ruin. A white elephant, Joyce. What with
income tax, land tax, death duties, price of labour—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you put it up for sale?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce stamped her foot, and her blue eyes looked piercingly
into her father’s grey ones. His were less courageous.
He looked sheepishly at Bertram, of whose presence he
had previously taken no notice at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Joyce,” he said, “I wish you wouldn’t be so
imperious! I’m an old man now. I’m getting devilish
hard-pressed in my old age, and I have the right to a little
domestic peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father, have you put it up for sale?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hesitated, shifted a little from one foot to the other,
and poked up a stone in the path with his thick cudgel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, my dear, I suggested to those damn fellows,
Huxted and Wells, that they might get an offer some
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the confession that Holme Ottery had been put
up for sale. Joyce accepted it as such.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a treachery!” she cried; “a treachery to Alban and
all of us. We won’t allow it. We ought to starve rather
than let the house go. All our history is there. It’s what
we mean and are. Without that we’re nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be a great sacrifice, my dear,” said the tenth
Earl of Ottery. He, too, looked up at the old house which
his forefathers had built, in which they had lived and died
and played their part in English history. There was a little
mist before his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A great sacrifice!” he said in a broken way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll talk to Mother about this!” said Joyce, savagely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lord Ottery smiled at her, and patted her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, go and talk it out with your Mother. She’s in her
room reading <span class='it'>The Times</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce ran up the terrace steps, without waiting for Bertram,
and the two men watched her slim, boyish figure disappear
through the doorway of the west turret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Women like talking,” said Ottery. “It doesn’t alter
things, though. Talking never did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He thrust his fingers through his red beard, and then
put his hand through Bertram’s arm, leaning on him a little
heavily. It was the first time he had ever done so, and
Bertram thought it was a sign of weakness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No amount of talk will bring back England to its old
state,” said Lord Ottery, gravely. “Only hard work and
good will, and honest government, and wise leadership, can
help towards that. The war has robbed us of our old
prosperity. We’re going to be poor. We must steel ourselves
to poverty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He whistled to his little white dog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hi, Clincher!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he asked Bertram whether he was an authority on
the Black Death. He found that subject wonderfully
interesting. It threw a great deal of light on the wage-system
in the Middle Ages.</p>

<div><h1>XXIV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce spent the rest of the morning in her Mother’s
room, and Bertram was left to amuse himself alone. It
was not very amusing. He was aware of a sense of isolation,
not for the first time, in this distinguished household.
Lord Ottery, after some minutes of almost intimate conversation,
and that episode of holding on to Bertram’s arm,
became absent-minded, and then, as though dismissing a
footman, gave Bertram to understand that he wished to be
left alone in the library, while he pursued his studies on
The Black Death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram strolled round the stables, where most of the
stalls were empty, though Ottery still kept a few hacks, and
Alban had his hunter, “Lightning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He passed a few words with the grooms, and found himself
reminiscing on the war. One of them had been with
“his lordship,” meaning Alban, Viscount Bellairs, in the
Grenadier Guards, and had been hit on the same day of
July ’16 in the attack on Morval and Lesbœufs. Afterwards,
for the second time, at Fontaine Notre Dame, below
Bourlon Wood, in November of ’17. Remembered the
great Tank attack in November ’20? Lord, yes! Major
Pollard was there with his machine guns? Fancy that! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Well, it seemed a long time ago, and like a dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Care to go through it all again?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two men laughed, appreciating some hidden joke,
not to be put into words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something was said about the strike.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Them Labour chaps ought to be mowed down by machine
guns,” said one of the men. “Dirty tykes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was amazed when Bertram said he thought they had
some justice on their side. It struck him “all of a heap.”
They were all bloody Bolsheviks, begging his pardon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram himself was astonished at this point of view of
men who had fought in the War and were of the same
class as those in the world of “labour” they denounced.
As he sauntered away, after a few light remarks, he supposed
they were survivals of English feudalism. Their
outlook was limited to the horizon of this old house. They
belonged to the Family. They were for the maintenance
of the Old Order which paid their wages, gave them perquisites,
belonged to their tradition of service. The War
hadn’t changed their mentality much. Strange!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He strolled round to the lake, and found Alban sitting
on the end of the punt, smoking a cigarette and reading
the <span class='it'>Sporting Times</span>, with his back to the wind. He was in
an old heather-green jacket and grey, moss-stained trousers,
with a cap at the back of his head, and looked better like
that, to Bertram’s yes, than in his town clothes, with white
spats and all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good morning!” said Bertram, with more geniality than
he quite felt, not having much affection for his brother-in-law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alban glanced over the top of the <span class='it'>Sporting Times</span>, and
allowed himself to show a faint surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo! Come down with Joyce?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Assured on this point, he became absorbed again in his
pink paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram waited a little while for the condescension of
another remark. Not obtaining that favour, he strolled
away again, cursing inwardly at the incivility of his
brother-in-law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A damned cad!” he said to himself. “An insufferable
snob!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet, as he had to admit to his sense of fairness, there
was no reason why Alban should have engaged in chatty
conversation. He himself resented fellows who were always
“yapping.” Alban wanted to read the <span class='it'>Sporting Times</span>.
There was heaps of room in the park for Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the Irish strain in me,” thought Bertram. “I’m always
suspecting uncivil treatment when none is meant.
It’s the ‘persecution’ mania. I’ll have to check it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, in spite of all these arguments, his moodiness was
increased at the luncheon table because of the almost complete
ignoring of his presence by Joyce and her family.
Not a word was said about the sale of the house—servants
being present—and there was some general gossip, mostly
by Alban and Lady Ottery, of a social and political kind.
The Prime Minister had gone to Chequers Court for
Easter, with his usual gang. The War Office had drawn
up a complete programme in case the strike led to any rioting.
General Bellasis was organising a Home Defence
Corps. All ex-officers would be asked to join.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doesn’t it seem unnecessary?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alban looked at him coldly, as he might have stared at
a junior subaltern of the Guards Mess, after an impertinent
remark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Extremely necessary,” he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lord Ottery put in a remark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bellasis is coming down for the week-end, he tells me.
We shall hear all about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram glanced at Joyce, and wondered whether she had
suggested this visit. He detested Bellasis. Joyce seemed
to be aware of his look, for she flushed, ever so slightly,
though she did not meet his eyes. She had been crying
again, he thought. Most unusual for Joyce. He felt very
sorry for her. Sitting there at the old dining-table, under
the portrait of Rupert Bellairs, fifth Earl, by Lely, it was
impossible to believe that Holme Ottery was up for sale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How like Joyce was to that fellow! He hadn’t noticed
it before. Although Charles II’s favourite had a plump
pink face, softened by long ringlets, he had the same kind
of eyes and nose as Joyce’s, with the same glint of steel in
the eyes. She sat next to her Mother, crumbling her bread
and looking thoroughly “vexed.” He had seen her in such
moods of late, at his own breakfast table, when she came
down to breakfast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Ottery had given Bertram a wintery smile, and
permitted him to kiss her cheek. He felt as though he had
kissed one of the marble pillars in St. Paul’s Cathedral.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A sharp frost last night,” she said, and as this statement
didn’t call for much of an answer, she seemed to forget
his presence, and engaged Alban in an argument on the
subject of Mrs. Asquith’s Memoirs, newly published, of
which she disapproved strongly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An outrage!” was her opinion, and she also believed
they would be used as propaganda by radicals who desired
to destroy society, and delighted in all such revelations of
corruption in high places.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems to me an extremely witty, harmless, and entertaining
book, Mother,” said Alban. “My only regret is
that it contains such little scandal. Think of all the things
she might have written!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we must have scandals, let us keep them to ourselves,
my dear,” said Lady Ottery, firmly. “In my young days
we hushed up anything that might prejudice our position
in the public mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most dishonest!” said Alban lightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think, Ottery?” asked Bertram’s mother-in-law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Entirely as you do, my dear,” said Lord Ottery, somewhat
vaguely, having been thinking, perhaps, of The Black
Death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram expressed an opinion upon Mrs. Asquith’s portraits
of “The Souls.” He thought it would be quoted centuries
hence as a picture of English life in the ’eighties.
His opinion did not seem to impress his wife’s family or
Joyce. There was no reply to his remark, and Alban
switched off the conversation to the character of his new
terrier—a cunning little devil with a hell of a lot of pluck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doing anything special this afternoon, Joyce?” asked
Bertram, towards the end of this meal which had been a
silent one for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m talking business with Alban,” said Joyce, in a most
determined voice, as though announcing an ultimatum to
Alban himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took it as such, and groaned a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly, old girl, much as I hate such palavers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Talking business with Alban. Not for Bertram to intervene.
He had no right to “barge in” upon such discussions,
though Joyce happened to be his wife. Well, he might do
a slope down into the village, and buy an afternoon paper,
or perhaps tramp over the Common, and watch the village
boys starting the season’s cricket. Holme Ottery was not
very sociable to-day to an outsider like himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was what he did, and he recovered his sense of
humour a little as he watched the game of cricket between
the youngsters of Ottery. He even laughed aloud at the
argumentative interruptions of the game, with wild and
angry shouts of “How’s that?” “That ain’t fair!” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
“Who’s umpire?” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “Umpire be blowed!” Youth didn’t
change, in spite of social upheavals, the passing of the Old
Order, houses to let, falling Empires, ruin in Europe,
threatened strikes, any damn thing. Boyhood survived,
with its laughter, its quarrels, its passionate excitement, its
game of life. Survived, in spite of war’s massacre! Many
of those kids must have lost fathers and brothers. The
shadow of the War had been over their childhood. They’d
seen women weeping at the news of death. But it had not
spoilt the spirit of youth. They’d forgotten the shadow.
Bertram wondered if any of them would live to see another
Great War, would live to die, as fathers and brothers
had died, in the same old battlefields, blown to bits, sliced
by flying steel, gassed, plugged with machine-gun bullets.
Not if he could do anything to save them. Not if his
book had any luck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How wonderful was the fruit blossom this year! The little
orchards round the Common were snowed under with
white and pink petals. The April wind was laden with
scent of apple-blossom, cherry-blossom, pear-blossom, and
drenched with the stronger perfume of lilac, splendid in
the cottage gardens. It stole into his senses like an opiate.
Why worry? This beauty of England endured through
the centuries, through civil strife, foreign wars, all kind of
trouble, soon forgotten. Spring had come again, with its
English loveliness, calling to his heart, putting its spell
upon the senses. Romance and love should go hand in hand
in little old villages like this. So they had gone hand in
hand, a year ago, when he and Joyce had wandered through
Ottery village, not caring because the village folk smiled
to see their love, glad of their friendly, smiling glances. A
year ago! They didn’t go hand in hand just now. Something
had come between them, some coldness. Perhaps
with the coming back of spring again, their love would
come back. He would woo Joyce again, as a humble lover,
as a passionate but patient lover. This very night he
would sue for her kisses, as once she had kissed him with
sweet lips. He would entice her down to the little wood
beyond the lake where one night they’d stood listening to
a nightingale, with their arms about each other, like children,
like Adam and Eve, like any man and any woman in
the spring-time of life, with pulses thrilling to the tune of
love, freshly heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sentiment! Romantic stuff! Well, why not?</p>

<div><h1>XXV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>He stood outside a quaint kind of shop on the edge of
Ottery Common, and wondered if he could get an
evening newspaper with late news from London.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was an old thatched cottage converted into a shop by
the simple plan of using the front garden as a show place
for antique furniture, brass warming pans, old china on old
tables, wooden toys—“made by Blinded Soldiers”—queer
odds and ends from attics and lumber rooms—a violin
without a bridge, silver spurs, a spinning wheel, a portrait
of the Prince Consort by Winterhalter, an oak cradle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In one of the cottage windows, with its little panes of
knobby green glass, was the notice, “Tobacco, Eggs, and
Ferrets.” In another window were the words, “London
Papers; Lending Library; Home-made Jams.” A useful
kind of shop! Anyhow, here was a chance of getting an
evening paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other people thought so too. A pretty girl, whom Bertram
dimly remembered as one of Joyce’s friends—the
Vicar’s daughter, perhaps,—rode up on a bicycle, left it
against the garden wall, and stepping over the oak cradle,
cried out in a merry voice:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Papers in yet, Mr. Izzard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A voice from the cottage answered as cheerily:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a damn one, Miss Heathcote!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ll wait. I want the latest news about the strike.
Is there going to be Civil War, do you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl—it <span class='it'>was</span> the Vicar’s daughter, as Bertram remembered—asked
the question as lightly as she might have
enquired about the chance of a shower. As lightly it was
answered through the open doorway of the cottage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not as far as I’m concerned. Having been a little hero
once, I’ve turned Pacifist. No more naughty strife for me!
Live and let live is my philosophy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No good hedging like that!” said Miss Heathcote, who
was sitting on an iron-bound chest, turning over some old
engravings. “ ‘He who is not with me is against me.’ Our
wicked Bolshevists will demand allegiance or hang you up
to one of your own oak beams.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ll sacrifice to the false gods!” said the voice inside.
“No martyr stuff for me. Thrice was I wounded in
Flanders.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Peace! Peace!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Caitiff!” cried Miss Heathcote.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram went into the shop, and said “Hullo, Izzard!
What on earth are you doing here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He’d remembered in a flash—that name and that voice.
Major Arthur Izzard, D.S.O., and a double bar to his M.C.,
the most reckless fellow he had ever met in a front line
trench, and one of the most comical. They’d spent some
merry and memorable evenings in old Amiens, down from
the line, between one “show” and another. Izzard had been
a great lad for the eggnogs in Charlie’s Bar, and proclaimed
his passion for Marguérite in the restaurant of “La Cathédrale.”
Now he seemed to be proprietor, serving-man, and
shop-boy in this village storehouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Bertram hailed him, he was sitting on the counter
with his legs dangling, arranging some eggs in a basket.
Deliberately he let one of the eggs fall and smash, as a sign
of his astonishment and delight at seeing Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great Scott! My old college chum!” (This had no
foundation in fact.) “My trusty comrade-in-arms! My
fellow-consumer of cocktails behind the lines of Armageddon!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gripped Bertram’s hand, and pump-handled vigorously,
and called in the Vicar’s daughter to be introduced
to another “little hero.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the game with this shop?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Arthur Izzard, D.S.O., said it was no game, but
the real business. Like thousands of other officers of the
Great War, he had worn out many boots, seeking a job in
London. Vainly. England was surfeited with home-coming
heroes. She’d nothing to offer them, after they’d
won the dear old war. She wanted to forget them. They
were a damned nuisance. So in a moment of brilliant inspiration,
he had set up this business for himself. It
amused him vastly. It also provided him with something
to eat. It also enabled him to do good to his fellow beings,
by spreading spiritual and intellectual light. He was the
centre of village culture. Mothers came to him for advice
upon the feeding of babies, maidens desired information on
the comparative merits of Ethel M. Dell and Zane Grey.
Farmers consulted him on insecticides. Miss Heathcote
discussed with him auto-suggestion and the Freudian theory.
He bought old furniture from Sussex cottages and sold it,
at outrageous profits, to the New Rich, and occasionally
Americans. He was a beneficent influence in Sussex, and
all the ladies loved him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some of the foolish ones,” said Miss Heathcote, laughing
and blushing in a way that suggested affectionate familiarity
with this good-looking fellow and his whimsical
ways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about social caste?” asked Bertram, and his question
amused young Izzard vastly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Caste? The damn thing has broken up like a jig-saw
puzzle! Not even the Countess of Ottery, poor old darling—your
mother-in-law, by the way!—can keep it going
nowadays, when Younger Sons are drifting into trade.
Why, Billy Wantage—Lord William of that ilk—is keeping
a pub at Wadcombe, and doing very well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conversation was interrupted by a red-haired boy
who rode up on a bicycle with a bag slung round his shoulders,
which he dumped into the cottage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You infernal young scoundrel!” said Arthur Izzard, “I
believe you’ve been watching the cricket-match.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Train late,” said the boy, grinning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Izzard seized the papers, and disregarding his customers,
read the news for himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hell!” he murmured to the company, which had increased
by two ladies, and an old gentleman of Mid-Victorian
aspect, with white whiskers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the latest?” asked Miss Heathcote.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strike officially begun. Two million men ‘out’ already.
The Triple Alliance will probably join.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What will that mean?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arthur Izzard gave him a queer look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may mean something like social revolution in little
old England. No trains, no supplies, no industry anywhere.
General paralysis until something smashes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Abominable!” said the old gentleman with white
whiskers. “We must smash the Trade Unions. They’re
the curse of the country. I’d flog every man who comes
out on strike.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Five million, maybe,” said Arthur Izzard, and he winked
at Bertram, as though with secret understanding. He said
something else, under his breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Comrades of the Great War.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d turn the machine-guns on to them,” said Miss Heathcote.
It was the opinion of Lord Ottery’s groom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arthur Izzard smiled at her as he sat on the counter and
swung his legs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if that would be wise—or kind—or safe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He waved his hand, as Bertram left the shop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in again, old man! I’ve excellent tobacco, new-laid
eggs, home-made jam, young ferrets, old instruments,
any old thing! And a private room for pals!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I certainly will!” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He walked back to Holme Ottery, thinking a little about
the Strike, but, strangely enough, not very much. He was
thinking more about Joyce. Something had stirred his
senses, this breath of spring, this countryside, this scent of
lilac and apple-blossom and wet earth. The memory of his
love-making, here, a year ago, recalled to his mind and heart
the joy of it, and his boyish ardour. London had put his
nerves on edge, and made him impatient, irritable, moody.
Perhaps Joyce had suffered too, in the same way, from the
artificial life, the depressing and lowering atmosphere of
London after war. It was better here. They might put
themselves straight again, recapture their former gladness
in each other, thrill again to the touch of each other’s hands,
and lips, to the warmth of body and soul. He would talk
to Joyce and woo her here back again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Holme Ottery was wonderful in the dusk of this April
day, with a silver streak, through a pile of dark clouds,
above its many gables and high chimneys, and shadows closing
about its grey walls. Through some of the windows in
the west wing, lights were gleaming, in a homely way.
Joyce was in one of those rooms, with her gold-spun hair,
and slim body, and all the beauty of the Bellairs women—like
that Joyce whom Steele had loved—and all their pride
and quality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A pity the old house was up for sale, but Joyce’s beauty
belonged to him.</p>

<div><h1>XXVI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>It was impossible to get a private word with Joyce before
dinner. Her “palaver” with Alban was still in progress
when Bertram returned, as he found when he went searching
for her in the morning-room, her bedroom, at the end
of the gallery, and at last in Alban’s little room on the other
side of the great stairway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alban called “Come!” sharply in answer to his tap at the
door, and did not look friendly when Bertram went in,
smiled at Joyce, and said, “Any chair for a mere husband?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce’s face was flushed. She and Alban were seated at
the table, which was strewn with papers. The brother and
sister were wonderfully alike, Bertram thought, as they sat
together, side by side. Joyce had the same profile as Alban,
though softened and more delicate, the same line of forehead
and nose, finely cut, like a Greek cameo. She took no
notice of Bertram’s entry, but went on talking to her
brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it comes to this: You insist on bleeding father to
the extent of four thousand a year, and Holme Ottery must
go to some horrible Profiteer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the position, apart from the word ‘bleeding,’ ”
answered Alban irritably. “You can see for yourself. The
Governor is paying taxes out of capital, borrowing for
upkeep, wages, and interest on mortgages, and breaking into
capital again for my little bit, and yours. When he pegs
out, death duties will swallow most of what’s left.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s disgraceful!” said Joyce. “It’s a damned disgrace!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose from the table, flinging back the papers, and
went over to the window, staring out into the dusk of the
park.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alban laughed, and drummed on the table with his finger-nails.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It all comes of having a democratic government, pandering
to the working-classes, bribing them with doles, and
ruining trade and capital by excessive taxes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Somebody must pay for the war,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alban became aware of his presence again, and answered
him gloomily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in that way. The Germans ought to pay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Bertram’s turn to laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even Germany can’t pay for the ruin of the whole world,
after her own losses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce swung round from the window seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For Heaven’s sake, Bertram! Don’t go pro-German,
after being pro-Irish, pro-Bolshevik, and anti-everything
that’s English and patriotic!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite so!” said Alban, associating himself with his
sister’s protest in a somewhat pompous manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram felt a sudden warmth in his blood creeping up
the back of his neck. He was not annoyed with Joyce, because
he could understand her sense of tragedy about the
old house. He was not angry with her, though her words
hurt him hideously, after his thoughts about her beauty and
the chance of re-capturing her love. But he had no use
for that “Quite so!” of his brother-in-law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fancy I did my job pretty well in the war,” he said
quietly. “If England ever needs me again .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He checked himself. What was the good of arguing?
Joyce and Alban were both on edge because of this family
crisis. Anyhow, he would be an idiot to proclaim his love
for England. It might be taken for granted after his
service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, bother all that!” cried Joyce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She dismissed the need of argument on that score by
another attack on her brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not going to let this business end in mere talk,
Alban! If there’s any chance of saving Holme Ottery—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alban’s temper mastered him for a moment, and he interrupted
his sister harshly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t I told you there’s no earthly chance? What’s
the good of playing about with unrealities? Facts are facts.
Figures are figures.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and your four thousand belong to the facts and
the figures,” answered Joyce, just as angrily. “If you gave
up gambling and racing, you could put some back into the
family pot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alban stared at his sister with that hard look which sometimes
came into his eyes, as Bertram knew. But he answered
icily, after a moment’s hesitation:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let’s have an altercation, or get down to personalities.
Four thousand is not too much for my position.
I’m extremely economical. I might remind you that father
settled two thousand a year on yourself. What about that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce spoke in a low voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d cut every penny of it to save Holme Ottery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alban leaned back in his chair, regarding his finger-nails,
and laughed more amiably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heroic, and all that, but utterly useless, little sister.
Besides, what about your own home? Bertram isn’t making
a fortune just now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll have to get a job,” said Joyce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the attack had come round to Bertram now. He was
to be made responsible, perhaps, for the necessity of selling
Holme Ottery! Perhaps, after further conversation, he
might be accused of instigating the Strike, and would be
saddled with the sins of the Government!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think I’ll get dragged into this family discussion,”
he said, with a desperate effort to be patient and
calm. “Anyhow, it’s time to dress for dinner. Coming,
Joyce?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Presently,” said Joyce. He didn’t wait for her, and went
up to his own room on the north side of the gallery, and
having shut the door with a bang, sat down on the bed with
his knees hunched up and his face in his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll have to get a job’ ” Joyce had said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, he’d found his job, and written his first book, now
in the publisher’s hands, and his first article, already published,
in <span class='it'>The New World</span>. Not much, but a good beginning.
He objected to Joyce’s way of speaking that sentence—“He’ll
have to get a job!” She had spoken it harshly.
Did she imagine that he hadn’t tried to get a job, that he
had been a slacker, an I-won’t-work? He had gone the
round of all his friends, answered advertisements—even
gone to a Labour Exchange!—in the hope of finding some
decent kind of work. He had agonised because of his idleness,
until he had sat down to write a book and found himself
writing it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not one of her precious Family had offered to help him.
Ottery had just stared vaguely at him when he had asked
for his influence. Alban wouldn’t walk a yard to get him
anything. Not all the crowd in Joyce’s set had put anything
in his way, though some of them pulled the social
wires. He must have a straight talk with Joyce before the
day was out. He must put himself right with her and
bring her back to him. Impossible that things should go
on in this way—this frightful, soul-destroying way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he brooded, and was late for dinner, and received the
rebuke of Lady Ottery’s frigid glance.</p>

<div><h1>XXVII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>There were several people from the neighbourhood
to dinner, and Bertram was amused to find himself
next to Miss Heathcote, the Vicar’s daughter, whom he had
met in Izzard’s oddity shop. They talked a little about
that, and the girl seemed nervous of owning friendship at
this table with a man who kept a shop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lady Ottery doesn’t approve of such new-fashioned
ways,” she whispered, glancing with amusement, and a
little fear, at the handsome lady at the head of the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram was less amused to see General Bellasis sitting
next to Lady Ottery, and Kenneth Murless on the other
side of Joyce. They had both come down for Easter as
old friends of the Bellairs family. The conversation at
their end of the table seemed to be about the Strike. General
Bellasis, handsome and florid as ever, was doing most
of the talking. Bertram heard only bits of sentences, disconnected
threads of his discourse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Serious challenge to Government authority.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. War
against Law and Order.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We must knock the stuffing
out of Labour! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Rank Bolshevism!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Heathcote girl on his left was prattling about a play
she had seen in London—one of Galsworthy’s. Jolly good!
Very daring, though. Her father was shocked when she
told him the plot. Parents were so easily shocked these
days. They didn’t realise the difference war had made to
the outlook of women. Everything was discussed. The
realities of life and death. Marriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram endeavoured to play up to her remarks, but his
glance kept wandering back to Joyce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She wore an evening frock of white silk, as simple as a
child’s, with a necklace of pearls, and in this old dining-room,
with its panelled walls and timbered roof and high-backed chairs,
looked in her rightful place. She belonged
to the house. The house belonged to her, not in timber and
stone, but in spiritual heritage. She was Joyce Bellairs of
Holme Ottery. The son of an Irish lawyer had no right to
her. She belonged to a different stock. She’d been bred
by centuries of “selection.” Bertram was but a clodhopper
to this child of Caste. So he thought, gloomily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth Murless was more of her kind. He too belonged
to a Family—the Murlesses of Warwick, with a genealogical
tree intertwined with branches of the Bellairs, Charringtons,
D’Abernons, Courthopes, Grevilles—all the proud
old stock. He kept Joyce amused at this dinner table, as
he always amused her, with absurd fantasies, word-play,
anecdotes, satirical verse, social caricatures, all charmingly
told, lightly, with ease, in a way unaffectedly, though he
had conceit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram observed him closely. Never by a single word
had Murless been uncivil, in the slightest degree discourteous,
in his relations with Bertram, though he must
have been aware of jealousy. Once or twice he went out
of his way at this dinner to smile at Bertram, though he
was too far down the long table to bring him into his conversation.
Once he raised his wine glass in friendly salute.
Bertram answered it, with a sudden sense of compunction
for his habitual sulkiness with Kenneth Murless. He was
a gentleman, and more genial than Alban Bellairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Ottery rose from her high-backed chair, with her
usual dignity. Dinner, even at home, was to her something
of a ritual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t talk too long, Ottery,” she said to her husband.
“Some of us would like a game of bridge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lord Ottery hated to be hurried over dinner, and said
so. Besides, Bellasis was talking about his plans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to hear them,” said Joyce. “I’ll join you later,
Mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She lit a cigarette, and sat on the arm of one of the oak
chairs, and took a sip out of Kenneth’s wine glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Bellasis shifted his chair round, so that he faced
the little group left at table—Lord Ottery, Alban, Kenneth,
Bertram, and Joyce. He had told them most of what the
Government had in mind. There was no doubt the Strike
was a threat to the whole authority of Parliament, to the
social order of England. The men’s leaders were fairly
sound, he thought, moderate in their ideas, on the whole.
But behind them was a real revolutionary agitation. Underneath,
undoubtedly, a lot of dirty work was going on by
paid agents with foreign gold. Bolshevists, pure and
simple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say rather, impure and artful!” said Kenneth Murless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Bellasis laughed, and waved his cigar at the
interruption.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His point was that the time had come when Labour had
given them the chance for a straight fight. They had challenged
“Us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meaning the Government?” asked Alban.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meaning the Decent Crowd,” said the General. “Anybody
with a stake in the country, including the unfortunate
Middle Classes. All of us. Well, we accept the challenge.
We’re ready to knock hell out of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lord Ottery expressed his view. He did not believe in
arranging a clash. He always avoided clashes, if possible.
The history of England, he thought, was in the main the
successful avoidance of the real issues. That was our
genius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I agree,” said Bellasis, in a tone which showed clearly
his disagreement. “But this clash has got to come. It’s
inevitable. We must get the working classes back to their
kennels. Back to cheap labour. Back to discipline. Otherwise
we’re done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s your plan?” asked Alban.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that’s the point,” said Ottery. “Has the Government
thought out a plan? I doubt it. They never think
out any plan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is all taped out,” said General Bellasis. “The War
Office has been working it out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lord Ottery mumbled something to the effect that this
didn’t inspire him with confidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Bellasis laughed again, rather irritably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, of course the War Office gets a lot of kicks. But
some of us aren’t such fools as we look.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nobody would accuse you of <span class='it'>looking</span> a fool, Bellasis,”
remarked Ottery in a kindly way, and he stared vaguely at
Kenneth Murless because that young man laughed loudly
at the remark, and even Joyce gave a little squeal of protest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed, after other conversational interruptions, that
the War Office plan, in the event of a General Strike was
to recruit a Defence Corps, divided into various districts
of England. Ex-officers and men would be invited to join
for a three months’ service. They would take over the
transport system, work the railways, organise lorry columns,
ensure the vital supplies of material life, meat, milk, bread,
and so on, and defeat the purpose of the strikers, which
was to strangle national industry and activity. If there were
any attempts at violence, intimidation, picketing, the Defence
Corps would be ordered to do their duty, relentlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fire on the mob?” asked Lord Ottery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fire on any ruffian, or body of ruffians, endeavouring
to hold up national life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Naturally,” said Alban.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope there’ll be a lot of shooting,” said Joyce, heatedly.
“A good opportunity to get rid of our Bolshevists.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram stiffened uneasily in his chair, and thought of
making a protest, but decided to keep his thoughts to himself.
He hated Joyce to speak like that. He was thinking
of Huggett, and his “Comrades of the Great War” in the
slums of London and other great cities, so many of them
out-of-work, despairing, rather bitter, but not Bolshevists.
This new Defence Corps might not be quick at distinguishing
between honest men and ruffians. Some chance shot,
any hooligan fool, might lead to bloodshed of a terrible kind.
This plan was to divide the nation into two classes. It
might come perilously near to civil war. He agreed with
old Ottery. Better avoid the clash. Better not to ask for
it. He wished Joyce had not spoken those words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Bellasis had swung further round in his chair,
and now faced Bertram with a friendly smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joyce tells me you want a job, Pollard? If that’s so,
I can put something in your way. How would it suit you
to help me run this show, as Deputy Director for the South
Coast?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram felt a sudden chill down his spine. He was conscious
that all eyes were turned upon him, Joyce’s, Alban’s,
Kenneth’s, Lord Ottery’s. He was aware that they expected
him to look “pleased,” eager to accept this offer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bertram—how splendid!” said Joyce. “A chance at
last!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What exactly does the ‘show’ mean?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He endeavoured to show polite interest, but his voice was
hostile, in spite of his effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Bellasis explained that it would mean a recruiting
campaign, then a certain amount of drill, to “lick the men
into shape”—and then the business of defensive patrols.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Military police work?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Bellasis said “Exactly!” and added his opinion
that it was a splendid opportunity for Bertram. It would
bring him under the eye of the Government—very useful—make
him a public character of some importance, and lead
undoubtedly to a good place later on in some Government
department. As Director of Home Defence, he could appoint
any man he liked for the post, and he had the greatest
pleasure in offering it to Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The offer was handsomely made, in the General’s best
style of good fellow and gallant soldier. It was received
with a chorus of congratulations from Joyce, Alban, and
Kenneth, with an expression of approval from Lord Ottery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’ll suit Bertram down to the ground,” said Joyce. “He
knows how to handle men, I will say that for him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was a little excited, and slipped off the arm of her
oak chair, standing with her hands clasping its high back,
and looking at Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good for you, Bertram!” said Kenneth Murless. “I’m
glad for Joyce’s sake as well as yours. I can think of no
better stepping stone to a sure place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alban concurred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An admirable post. Service to the country. Good pay,
not bad fun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lord Ottery agreed. He thought it “Very handsome of
the General.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce was watching her husband. She could read his
face better than the others. She saw how first he flushed
and then paled a little, while a tuck gathered his forehead
into a frown. He was thinking hard, and not certain of
his answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exceedingly kind of you, General,” he said, slowly.
“Many thanks. But somehow, I don’t like the job.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was silence for a moment or two in the big dining
room where many generations of Bellairs had sat at table,
discussing events of history, more unfortunate than this,
quarrelling, laughing, feasting, drinking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t like the job?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Bellasis smiled, not good-humouredly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s wrong with it?” asked Alban, icily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell us!” said Kenneth Murless, raising his eyebrows
in a quizzical way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce spoke more emotionally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bertram! Pull yourself together. If you don’t accept
this—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last words seemed to hold a threat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram thrust his hands into the pockets of his dinner
jacket, and leaned forward in his chair, staring at the carpet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s like this—” he said, groping for the right words;
“I don’t like to see people of our class—your class, if you
like!—organising their forces to beat down poor devils who
want to keep up a decent standard of life, after a war they
helped to win. I’ve looked into the question of this Strike.
It’s really a Lock-out by the masters—but, anyhow, the men
are being offered wages which aren’t quite good enough,
they think. Not a fair deal for men who helped to save
England. They may be wrong, of course, but that’s how
it seems to them. This Defence Force—it sounds all right.
I’m ready to serve on the side of law and order. But it
looks like a Snob Force for giving Hell to working-men
who want a living wage. Aristocracy versus Democracy.
Middle Classes against the Mob. Yes! If necessary, I
quite agree. But I fought <span class='it'>with</span> the Mob. I saw it going
over the top on mornings of battle. I walked through its
dead bodies afterwards. I learnt to know its spirit, and
liked it, on the whole. I’d hate to shoot down fellows who
used to salute me in the trenches, and whom I saluted as
the salt of England. Of course order must be kept. I
understand that. No body of men must be allowed to blackmail
a nation, and there may be a bit of that in the minds
of the Labour leaders. But there seems to be an idea—General
Bellasis hinted at something of the sort—that a little
blood-letting wouldn’t be a bad thing. Some idea of forcing
the clash, so as to teach Labour a lesson, with machine-guns,
and so on. I know something about machine-guns.
I served ’em in the Great War. I’m not inclined to turn
them against my own men—unless Hell breaks loose.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
And I don’t think Hell is going to happen. It’s a newspaper
scare, and nothing else. It’s not going to happen,
unless it’s made to happen. I’ll see myself damned before
I help to make it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Do you see my point, General?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had let him speak out, without a single interruption,
in dead silence. He had been aware of their faces about
him. Joyce had become quite white. She was still standing
with her hands on the back of the tall chair, and her
eyes were fixed on Bertram with a look of amazement,
at first, and then anger. Once or twice she smiled, in a
queer way, as though some of his words seemed to her too
ridiculous. Alban sat with his head bent, glowering. Kenneth
Murless was watching him, with a look of extreme
interest, as though at some new phenomenon of human nature.
Lord Ottery sat back in his chair with closed eyes,
fingering his red beard. The General had become restless,
crossed and recrossed his legs, shifted a wine glass, flushed
angrily, and then met Bertram’s eyes with a hard, hostile
look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I regret my offer has been refused with such a distasteful—I
may say, disgraceful—expression of opinion, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was his answer to Bertram’s argument, and he
spoke it harshly, in a court-martial manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce moved away from her chair, and stood by the great
fireplace. Bertram knew by a glint in her eyes that she was
deeply emotional at that moment, but she spoke to the General
quietly, with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not refused. Bertram permits himself a certain
amount of hot air. Why not? But he accepts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that so?” asked the General, looking first at Joyce and
then at Bertram, with perplexity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s so, isn’t it, Bertram?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram’s eyes met Joyce’s. He saw in them a kind of
entreaty, and behind that a kind of command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid not,” he said. “I hate the idea of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce moved away from the fireplace. She still spoke
quietly, but there was a new thrill in her voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I apologise for my husband, General! But if Bertram
doesn’t accept, I shan’t think much of his loyalty to me—or
to England. Meanwhile, I’d better join Mother, who’s
probably fuming at my absence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She left the room with her head held high, and a little
smile about her lips, but Bertram, who knew the play of
light and shadow in her face, saw that she was passionately
distressed with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was silence for a moment after her going, until it
was broken by Alban Bellairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you’re a damned fool, Bertram. Have you gone
Bolshie or something?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve explained my views,” said Bertram, coldly; “I
don’t expect you to understand them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth Murless thought a little tact might help, and
spoke in his agreeable voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see his point of view. It’s extremely interesting as a
study in sentiment. I don’t agree, of course, being a hopeless
Reactionary, thank goodness, undisturbed by any liberal
or revolutionary thought.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lord Ottery was about to utter a judicial opinion, but
decided that it was hardly worth while after dinner,—and
dozed a little with his red beard on his shirt front.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Bellasis cut short all further discussion, in his
hard, matter-of-fact way when dealing with men. He had
another manner in the presence of women he liked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For your wife’s sake, Pollard, I make the offer again,
for ‘yes,’ or ‘no,’ without argument. Which is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram did not answer for a second or so, but in that
time he reviewed his life with Joyce, and saw with tragic
certainty that this was the crisis. Acceptance meant surrender
of his ideals, such as they were, and definite allegiance
to opinions and acts which would put him for ever
on the side opposed to liberal thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was to decide between Joyce’s “crowd” and the labouring
classes of England, or at least between the philosophy
of men like Bellasis, summed up in the phrase, “Give ’em
Hell!” and that of Christy who believed in human brotherhood.
This job, offered by Bellasis, would kill the friendship
of men like Christy, Lawless, Bernard Hall. They
would put him with the Junker class, and turn their backs
on him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not that that would matter, if he did the right thing. But
this was the wrong thing. It would be a surrender to
stupidity. It would be the sale of his intelligence for the
sake of position, and peace with Joyce—a sin against the
Light. Peace with Joyce? Joyce’s love and favour? It
would be worth while to surrender a good deal for that—everything
in the world, but a man’s honour to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These people, Bellasis, and Alban, and Kenneth Murless,
and all their kind, extremists in reaction, were asking him
to betray his sympathy with the men who had been his
comrades in the lousy trenches. To go right over to the
Bellasis side—one day to give an order to shoot, perhaps—would
be to break faith with Bill Huggett and all poor
devils like him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw Huggett now as a Type, the Cockney soldier back
to civil life, back to his slums, trying to keep his “kids,”
uncertain of work from one week to another, begging
“bobs” from passers-by when there was no work. It was
to bring such men to heel that the Bellasis band were organising
their forces, recruiting University boys, and unemployed
officers—the way to conflict! What had old
Christy said? “Loyalty to lies is disloyalty to truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So in that second or two, these thoughts rushed into
Bertram’s head, and he made his decision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, General. Thanks very much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Bellasis rose from his chair, and flung the end
of his cigar into the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s join the ladies,” he said sternly, as though dismissing
a battalion on parade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lord Ottery awakened from his dose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, a game of bridge, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth Murless opened the door, and waited until the
General and Ottery had left the room, and then Alban
looking black-tempered. For a moment Kenneth lingered,
glancing at Bertram, who was standing by the chimney-piece,
staring into the redness of the log-fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speaking as an Egoist,” he remarked in a genial way,
“I’m distressed by your violation of self-interest, Bertram,
but uplifted by your idealistic faith.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Much obliged for your favourable opinion!” said Bertram,
kicking a burning log.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murless smiled, and followed the others to the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alone in the great dining-room of Holme Ottery—up for
sale—Bertram used his old catch-word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all very difficult!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His face was lit by the warm glow of the fire as he stirred
the embers with his boot, and there was a look of pain in
his eyes when he raised his head and glanced at the portrait
of Joyce Bellairs whom Steele had loved. He spoke her
name, but it was of his wife he was thinking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My poor Joyce!” he said.</p>

<div><h1>XXVIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>When Bertram went to the drawing-room, he found
a foursome at bridge in progress—Lord and Lady
Ottery, Joyce, General Bellasis. Kenneth was making himself
agreeable to Miss Heathcote and presently suggested
a game of “pills,” so that they left the room together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing doing for Bertram, who felt that he was frozen
out. Joyce deliberately avoided his glance, or, at least,
never looked his way, though he tried to entice her eyes by
wandering around, shifting a little porcelain figure on the
mantelpiece, and rattling a few coppers in one of his
pockets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wanted her to look at him. He had a foolish idea
that he might send her a message with his eyes, asking for
her understanding, and for her comradeship. But she
seemed to be absorbed in her game, and was gay in altercation
with her partner, General Bellasis. Bertram’s endeavour
to establish communication with her was answered
only by Lady Ottery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t fidget, Bertram! My partner is sufficiently
trying.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her partner was her husband, Ottery, who resented this
slight upon his ability at bridge by a mild protest of “That’s
unfair, my dear!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The situation was ludicrous as far as Bertram was concerned.
He knew that for him this was a night of crisis.
He had made the great refusal, for what he believed to be
conscience’ sake. He wanted passionately to talk it over
with his wife. Some long emotional strain had reached its
breaking point to-night in his relation to Joyce. His heart
must speak to hers now, urgently. This polite, distant, unnatural
way between them must be broken by plain talking,
by the rough reality of human nature. He couldn’t wait
any longer for that. They must have it out, once for all,
and now.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But meanwhile Joyce played bridge with
Bellasis, and without looking at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would make her look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While Bellasis was writing down the last results of play,
Bertram went to their table and bent over Joyce with his
hand on her shoulder. She gave a little shrug, which he
knew meant to say, “Take your hand away,” but he kept
it there, heavily, and spoke to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to speak to you, Joyce, presently. After your
game.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hasn’t there been enough talk?” she asked, impatiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he said, “there’s got to be more. I’ve something
important to say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Ottery tapped his hand with a card case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Bertram. Please don’t interrupt. Can’t you
find something to read?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry!” said Bertram, “but I wanted to have the favour
of a few words with Joyce presently.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The night’s young,” said Ottery, impatiently. “Don’t
spoil the game, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your answer, Joyce?” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him now, straight in the eyes, with a
challenge of will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After the game, and when I’m ready. Not before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went out of the room, and out of the house, and for
more than an hour wandered about the park.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a warm night on the last day of April, with a
three-quarter moon, so that the branches of the trees were
silvered and the lawns flooded with a milky radiance. The
old house with its tall chimneys flung black shadows across
the terrace paths, and the broken Venus gleamed white
above the flight of steps to the rose gardens. The night
air was still fragrant with the scent of flowers and damp
grass, and warm earth. In the long avenue down which
Bertram paced, a nightingale was singing to its mate, with
little trills of passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram remembered the last time he had heard a
nightingale singing like that. It was in Notre Dame de
Lorette, after a battle at Lens. The red flash of gunfire
made a regular pulsation of light through the shell-gashed
trees and the roar of bombardment shook the very earth.
But the little bird in the tree went on singing to its mate.
Queer! Even with men, love and the mating business of
passion went on and would not surrender its claim though
half the world was in ruins and civilisation was menaced
by many dangers, and the individual had no sense of security.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was the best philosophy, the only way of life. It
was ridiculous to worry over much about the future. Old
Christy was always worrying, and trying to put the world
right. Better, perhaps, to carry on, like peasants and plain
folk, for self-preservation, for the essential needs and appetites
of self-existence—and let the world take care of
itself. Holme Ottery was in ruins, like half the world.
This old house, so stately in its hushed gardens and wooded
parkland, so beautiful in this moonlight, as at noonday, had
reached its last phase of life, at least as the roof-tree of the
family which had built its beauty. Did it matter very
much? Not if the life of the family went on to new development,
following the thread of fate through changing
ways—not if Joyce still loved her mate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram felt the stir of passion in his blood, as several
times this day. Joyce challenged him. She disapproved
of his ideas, and was angry because he had decided something
against her wish. She put her will-power against
his, tried to coerce him to her way of thinking, spoke with
satire, irritably, harshly. That was all nonsense! Life
was bigger than that. Love was bigger. He would make
Joyce his mate again, not by argument, and intellectual
duels, but by passion, by the emotion that stirred in him on
this night of April, as it stirred the little creeping things
of the warm earth there, and was astir in the hedges and
ditches, and bushes and woods, of this Holme Ottery and
all other places, and had been stirring since life began, because
this was life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When after an hour Bertram went back towards the
house by way of the rose-gardens, and the long pergola,
through which the moonlight crept, he heard Joyce’s voice.
She was speaking quietly, and he saw her figure in a black
cloak sitting at the top of the steps on the parapet. She
was in the full white light of the moon, though not sharply
outlined, because of its filmy glamour. Below her, sitting
on the top step, with his knees tucked up and his hands
clasped round them, was a man’s figure, his shirt-front
gleaming very white. It was Kenneth Murless’s long and
elegant form, as Bertram could see by his very attitude.
Their voices sounded clearly across the garden, though they
weren’t speaking loudly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’ll break my heart to leave Holme Ottery,” said Joyce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sad! Horribly sad!” answered Kenneth. “It’s a tragic
world altogether for our little lot. We belong to the past.
You and I, Joyce, are prehistoric survivals. Awful thought,
that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We needn’t surrender without a fight,” said Joyce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth Murless laughed with his soft musical note.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God is on the side of the big battalions, my dear! The
mob is moving out. We haven’t a chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Hell with the mob!” said Joyce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth laughed again, pleasantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your husband would hate to hear you say that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce didn’t answer for a moment, and then spoke
harshly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bertram’s a traitor to our side of things!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush!” said Kenneth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was when Bertram walked out of the pergola and
came up the terrace steps and stood quite close to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joyce,” he said quietly, “you and I must have a talk,
if Kenneth will permit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth stood up, and smiled rather nervously at
Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m off to bed, old man. Good night, both.” He walked
quickly back to the house, leaving Bertram to Joyce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m for bed too,” said Joyce. “It’s too late for talk.
And you heard what I said, I presume?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That word ‘traitor’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew her cloak closer about her shoulders, and
moved towards the house, but Bertram took her by the
wrist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve got to have it out, Joyce. Shall it be here, in
the garden, or indoors?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She tried to release her wrist—the same wrist which he
had hurt over a telephone—but he held her fast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indoors,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He held open the door of the little turret for her, and
as two could not pass together, released her wrist as she
went in. She slipped away from him then, and ran lightly
up the stone stairs which led to the gallery round the great
staircase, and her bedroom. She had the door of her room
almost slammed in his face before he reached her, and
held the door-handle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not quick enough!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stood facing each other rather breathlessly inside
her room. Joyce laughed a little, but in a baffled, angry
way, like a thwarted child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the first time I’ve been in this room,” said Bertram.
He looked at the smallness of it, and the neatness. It had
been Joyce’s room since she had left her nursery in the
house. Some of her girlhood’s treasures and toys were
there; a doll’s-house in the corner, a pair of skates hanging
over a cupboard, a horse-shoe, tied up with ribbon, over
the mantelpiece, photographs of herself and Alban on Shetland
ponies, a pair of foils crossed on one of the walls,
and a fox’s brush—her first—over the narrow wooden bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you won’t stay here long,” said Joyce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She slipped off her cloak and sat in an old wicker chair
by the stone-piece where a small fire had almost burnt out.
She still had the look of a rebellious child—a King’s page,
with curled, cropped hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joyce,” said Bertram, “have you forgotten that I’m
your husband, and you’re my wife?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that what you’ve been waiting to ask me all the
evening?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She teased him with her mockery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By God, it is!” he said quickly. “And I want an answer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She answered him in the worst way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I could forget a most unfortunate fact!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps she didn’t mean to be quite brutal with him.
It’s likely that she was just trying his temper, and yielding
to her own. But it hit him hard, and he reeled under the
blow, not only in a mental way, but physically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean that?” he asked, staring at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it true? For you as well as for me? Surely you
see the misfortune of our marriage? You don’t like my
ideas, my character, my whole outlook on life. That’s unfortunate
for you. I detest yours. That’s unfortunate
for me. We belong to different sides. That’s unfortunate
for both of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram marvelled at the cold way in which she could
speak these things. Had she forgotten, utterly, how she
had loved him once, and all his devotion to her? Did it
mean nothing to her that she had been the mother of his
dead child? Was she so heartless that she could see herself
divided from him by that sheer gulf of which she spoke,
and not agonise at its tragedy, nor weep, but talk so calmly,
so coldly of its happening? No, he didn’t believe that.
Heart and soul refused to believe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear!” he said. “My dear! Don’t let’s say bitter
and frightful things because we’re out of temper. I know
it’s so easy. It’s a question of nerves, little irritations,
small rotten differences that mean—just nothing. They
don’t matter more than passing shadows. What does matter
is our love, above and beyond all that. I want to tell
you that my love for you is unaltered, and unalterable, although
you have been pretty rough on me lately, and not
given love, or anything like a fair deal.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But I want to
wipe out the remembrance of that. I want you and me to
get together again, as comrades and mates. Nothing else
would matter then. Our different points of view? Oh,
Lord! how trivial! Joyce, take me back to your bed and
your heart, and your beauty, and let’s make a game of life
again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He leaned over her, put his arms around her, tried to
draw her close to him, as she sat there in the wicker chair
by the little fire that had almost burnt out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew her chair back on the polished boards, and
sprang up, beyond his reach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s all this stuff you’re talking?” she said, angrily,
two spots of scarlet on her face. “You say you love me.
Why do you always jeer at my friends and my ideas? Sulk
in my drawing-room? Behave like a boor to my crowd?
Ally yourself with Pacifists and pro-Germans and revolutionaries?
You say you love me, and talk sentiment. Less
sentiment, please, and more honesty. That offer to-night!
It was a test of loyalty. To England in a big way—certainly
to me, as far as I mean anything in your life. Yet
you refused it. You failed to pass the test. Why, from
the lowest point of view, you ought to want to keep your
end up, and pay your own way, like an honest man! You
remember the word I spoke to Kenneth? I use it again
now, to your face. You’re a traitor to the things I stand
for, to all I am. Until you do something to put yourself
right again, I won’t live with you. It’s dishonouring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By God!” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was white to the lips now, with anguish and rage.
This girl used her tongue like a lash. She cut his heart
open, flayed his soul. And yet, as she stood there, facing
him, he loved her with an extreme passion, and her beauty
was a torture to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He acknowledged the truth of some things she said. He
had jeered at her friends, often enough. He had sulked in
her drawing-room. He had behaved like a boor to her
crowd. All that was true. But the rest of it was not true,
and it was cruel. She called him traitor—he who loved
England as he loved Joyce, hungrily, so that the smell of its
earth, as the fragrance of her hair, excited his senses,
touched him with spiritual emotion. It was damnable that
she should use such words. “Dishonouring!” she said.
She wouldn’t live with him because it was dishonouring!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He strode a pace towards her, and caught hold of her
right arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the old days a man would have flogged his wife for
such words. I’ve a damned good mind to box your ears.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have a try!” said Joyce, breathing hard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He didn’t box her ears, but let her arm go and dropped
his hands to his side, and stood there with his head bowed,
staring at the floor. There was silence between them for at
least a minute, which seemed like an hour. Joyce for the
first time was weeping, with her face turned away from
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently he spoke again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It rather looks as though I’d made a mistake. I thought
you still loved me, in spite of drifting away a bit. It
seems any love you once had is like that little fire of yours—not
much ever, and now burnt out. Why, God alone
knows, not I! But it’s a pity. Perhaps it’s my fault partly.
I may come to see that one day. Now, to-night, I think
you’ve been hellish to me. I’ll clear out to-morrow.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
If you want me ever, I’ll come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood at the doorway, looking back at her. She stood
by the side of the little bed where she had slept as a child,
with her face turned away and her body shaken by sobs.
He hated to part from her like that, and this was the
parting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke her name once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joyce!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She didn’t answer him, and he left her room and shut
the door. Next morning he left Holme Ottery before
breakfast, and went back to town, but not to the little house
in Holland Street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went to his mother’s house in Sloane Street, and
asked for his old room.</p>

<div><h1>XXIX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pollard was astonished and distressed when
her son told her that he wanted to use his old room
for a few weeks. She guessed, in spite of his carefully
vague explanations, that something had gone wrong between
him and Joyce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His “explanation” left much to be explained. He suggested
that Joyce was immensely upset by the proposed
sale of Holme Ottery, and might stay down there a while
to see the last of the old home. But that was no reason
why he shouldn’t stay with her, or go back to the little
house in Holland Street. He countered that by saying he
hated loneliness, and as he had to keep close to town for
his literary work, preferred to take up his old bachelor
quarters. Besides, it would be good to see so much of his
mother again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t you pleased, little mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had the humiliation of asking her to lend him some
money, but to her it was a pleasure, and she wrote him a
cheque for more than he could use in a twelve-month, and
said, “With my love and blessing, dear!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She knew he was concealing some secret from her. His
face, which she could read like an open book—so much
like her own!—told her that he was suffering a hidden
wound, which hurt him horribly. He couldn’t hide much
from a mother who lay awake at night listening to his footsteps
pacing up and down in his room overhead—would
he never go to sleep?—and who heard him groan now and
then, like a tortured soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid you had a bad night, dear,” she would say
in the morning, and wouldn’t believe him when he said,
“Oh, no. I slept all right after thinking out a few things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She accepted all his explanations for her husband’s
benefit. Michael, to whom she announced the news of his
son’s home-coming, did not see any mystery underlying it,
but only inconvenience to the servants who had been reduced
in number since the break-up of the family. He had
a respectful admiration for Joyce Bellairs as the daughter
of the Earl of Ottery, and sympathised—he said—with her
sentiment about the old house. Doubtless she would wish
to stay there before it was bought by some American millionaire
or some war-profiteer. Most natural and commendable.
As for Bertram, he hoped the boy would spare
him political altercations—they seemed to disagree on most
subjects—and any reference to more painful episodes which
he had entirely removed from his mind. By that, as
Mrs. Pollard knew, he referred to his eldest daughter’s
German marriage, and Susan’s Irish adventure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram “spared” him everything with regard to these
forbidden subjects. He met his father only at breakfast,
and exchanged a few commonplace remarks over the eggs
and bacon. Their first greeting had been characteristic of
the somewhat strained relations existing between them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hulloa, father! Here’s the Prodigal back. Don’t
bother about the fatted calf.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good morning, Bertram. Putting in a bachelor week?
I shan’t see much of you as I’m desperately busy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t worry about that, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram’s father became absorbed in <span class='it'>The Morning Post</span>.
After breakfast he retired to his study for an hour. At
ten o’clock he drove down to the Temple. Occasionally
he returned for dinner, but Bertram generally dined out, if
he knew that his father was expected. At midnight, or
thereabouts, Mr. Michael Pollard, K.C., M.P., having completed
a day of arduous toil on behalf of law and order
and the good governance of a great Empire, came home
again, and retired to rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram, at that time of night, was generally in his own
room, pacing up and down, not aware that every footstep
was heard by his wakeful mother. He was “thinking out a
few things,” as he told her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were not pleasant things, nor easy. Since the war
he had made a complete failure of his life. He had made
a hopeless mess of his marriage. Here he was back again,
in his bachelor state, in the little old room where, as a
boy, he had lived in a dream world of hope and ambition.
How many times he had sat on this bed, generally with one
boot off and one boot on, looking into the unknown future
with a boy’s impatience for its coming, thinking of love and
its mystery, wondering about the girl who somewhere was
waiting in the world to be his mate, to fulfil the vague and
wonderful promise of life which as yet he saw only as on
the threshold of its glory. Now he knew! He had met
the girl of his vision, and she had abandoned him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had never thought of that possibility, when he had
sat with Romance as his source of knowledge in this little
room. That was before the War had come crashing into
Romance with terrific realism. That was in old quiet days
when it had seemed adventure enough to wander through
London on journeys of exploration, and when books of
travel, history, drama, were more exciting than anything
that really happened in modern life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He used to put his head out of this window looking
down on Sloane Street, listening to the rush of traffic,
after theatre time, until it was very quiet, and only a late
hansom—the last of their kind—came with a klip-klop up
the street, or a primitive “taxi” honked its horn. The sky
was always quivering with the lights of London, above the
chimney-pots, as high as the stars. The boy Bertram used
to stare at that radiance, with his room all dusk behind
him, so that his mother would be worried by his keeping
awake—“reading in bed” was her passionate dread!—and
it seemed to him like a mirage of life itself, with all its
mystery and enchantment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ten years ago! Not more than that, though a whole
life-time in experience. Four and a half years of war had
intervened, awaking Bertram and the world out of false
dreams and beatific visions. Four and a half murderous
years, crammed with death, and horror, and heroism, and
laughter, and boredom, and fear, and filth. Then a year
of marriage—worse than war. More difficult than the
technique of war, more nerve-racking, and more terrifying
than death in the results of failure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here he was, after complete failure, back in his bachelor
room, as Joyce was in hers! Yet not back again as before.
Impossible to get back to the boy who was here in this
room ten years ago. Those books on the shelves which
had meant so much then, meant nothing now, had no comfort
in them, no romance, no thrill of any kind, no wisdom.
Not even Shakespeare, in the old Leopold edition, could
give Bertram any solution to his problem of marriage with
Joyce. Shelley, Browning, Laurence Housman, Kipling—all
the poets he had loved—what could they tell him now?
“Damn all!” as the men used to say in war time. Conrad,
Stevenson, Quiller-Couch, Barrie,—Lord! he could hardly
bear to look at them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over his mantelpiece were photographs of Dorothy and
Susan, and a small boy—Digby—in knickerbockers and an
Eton collar; Dorothy as a girl of eighteen, with her hair
“up” for the first time, wonderfully pretty in an evening
frock of a style now hopelessly old-fashioned; Susan as a
girl of sixteen, with a short white frock, and long black
stockings, laughing like a tomboy. The last few years of
history had made a difference to them. Dorothy was Frau
von Arenburg, a “Hun’s” wife; Susan the wife of an
Irish rebel now in prison; Digby, the boy in knickerbockers,
a Black and Tan. And Bertram, their brother, staring at
these old photographs, touching his old books, sitting on
his bed with his head in his hands, was ex-Major of machine
guns, now unemployed, and ex-husband of Lady
Joyce Bellairs, of Holme Ottery, in the county of Sussex.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had received one letter from Joyce since that night at
Holme Ottery. He had read it ten times or more, and then
torn it up into small pieces.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;'><span class='sc'>My Dear Bertram</span>:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scene you made last night was inexcusable, except
on the score that you are still suffering from shell-shock or
some war neuritis. It’s impossible for us to live together
while you continue in that mental state. I suppose your
sudden departure this morning means that you are of the
same opinion. Whether we ever come together again
depends on you. When you can afford to keep me, and
when you prove your loyalty to my ideals, I shall be glad
to live with you again. Not till then. I’ve decided to
give up Holland Street and stay here with Mother until
Holme Ottery is sold, which I pray will not be soon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I know you think I’ve been hard and “unsympathetic,”
and unkind. Of course, there’s something to be said on
your side. I know you’ve loved me in your passionate,
emotional way, as much as any man could. I’m grateful
for good times we had in the beginning. But that’s only
one side of love, the animal side which I dislike. I want
the other side of love, which is, surely, communion of
ideas, comradeship in understanding, the same faith and
code. That you’ve not given me. However—it’s past argument
now.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:4em;'>Yours,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'><span class='sc'>Joyce</span>.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Past argument now! Well, he was not going to re-open
the argument. So he told her in his answer to that letter.
Perhaps he’d been a fool to write so much—sheet after
sheet, revealing the secret things of his mind, the strain
and stress of his nature, pulled two ways by two strains of
blood, a conflict between old tradition and the new hopes
of humanity, resistance to extremes of thought, so that he
might plod along the Middle of the Road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The strain and stress of his nature! He had made her
understand, if words were plain, that she was the cause of
his irritable temper, so much of his impatience. His love
for her was passionate, as she said, and a man couldn’t suppress
passion too long, without nerve-storms. Long before
the child was born, and ever since, she had made no
response to his emotion, and kept him at a distance, coldly.
Her presence, the scent of her hair, the turn of her head,
the touch of her finger-tips, made his thrill to her, but
though she had been so close to him, always putting this
strain upon his senses and his vital nature, she had repulsed
him, resisted any intimate contact with him, deliberately
held him in exile. She hadn’t played the game by him.
She had shirked her marriage vows. She had made his
married life an agony—and intolerable, because of the
very greatness of his love! She wrote about communion
of ideas. Yes, he agreed with that, utterly. But communion
means exchange, give and take, a little yielding on
both sides, tolerance, understanding. She had never troubled
to get his point of view. She had never stood on tip-toes
to see over his side of the hedge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had taken her stand with the Old Caste and the least
liberal part of that, the extreme high and dry section of
it, left behind by the great tide of changing life, now in
England, at last, after the opening of the sluice gates by
the shock of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was not intolerant of her ideals. He was pulled
back to them against reason, even, by old sentiment, the
romance of history, by the very ghosts of England. He
could understand her resentment of change which meant
the downfall of Holme Ottery, as one symbol of a passing
era. He understood and grieved with her, because he
loved the old stones of England and every brick in every
wall. But he saw the inevitability of change, the need and
right of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood with his face to the future, not weeping with
his head turned backwards to the past. He had tried to
make her understand his view of life. She’d not troubled
to understand. Because he had not agreed with abject submission
to her ideas, her old-fashioned, out-worn creed,
she’d used that word “traitor!” and cut his heart open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for his being able to keep her, he had understood that
she wasn’t in a hurry for him to pay his board and lodging.
They’d had that argument out before, and she had
promised to give him time. She’d broken that promise—a
week or so too soon! A little more patience, perhaps,
and he would have proved his quality as a writing-man,
by getting a fair price for hard work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had not been a slacker. He had slaved over his
book, late into the night. He would have gone on slaving,
joyously, to earn a decent living, to pay for the things she
liked, to take his share of life’s costs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, “it was past argument now!” Agreed! No further
argument should come from him. Nor did he intend
to crawl to her, whining, to be “taken back.” By God, no!
If she wanted him, she would have to ask for him. She
would have to beg him to return, without conditions, on
equal terms, acknowledging his right, and persuading him
of love. Otherwise, never. And perhaps never, even then,
if she waited too long, for even loyalty couldn’t suffer too
great a strain, though now he sent her his love.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he had written, or in some such way, all night, with
spells of thought when he had laid his head down on his
arms, and, even, had wept a little like a weak boy. She
hadn’t answered the letter. It was “past argument, now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His mother worried him by trying to get at his secret.
A dozen times a day she spoke about “dear Joyce,” and
he had to fence with her until about a week after his coming
back she broke down his guard, and he told her everything,
or nearly everything. Then he was put into the
absurd position of defending Joyce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His mother was indignant with her son’s wife, called her
a “selfish creature,” and a “heartless hussy,” and couldn’t
understand at all how any wife could so behave to any husband.
It was, she said, “the moral breakdown caused by
the war.” English girls seemed bereft of their senses,
judging from the daily papers, and all the dreadful divorce
cases. Joyce was another example of that. She wanted,
like all the others, nothing but pleasure. Duty never entered
her head. Self-sacrifice for love’s sake was not acknowledged
these days. She was merely an empty-headed
creature, with bobbed hair and short skirts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother!” said Bertram, “I can’t let you speak of Joyce
like that! She’s not in the least empty-headed. On the
contrary, she’s stuffed full of knowledge and ideas. As
for her bobbed hair, it’s the fashion, and a pretty one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Absurd—to be defending Joyce who had given him Hell!
Yet he did so, time and time again, until at last he became
angry, and said, “Let’s give up talking about it, mother,
for goodness’ sake! You don’t understand Joyce’s point of
view, or mine. It’s impossible to explain. I can’t explain
it to myself. I only know that it’s a frightful tragedy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hated to talk roughly to his mother. The love she
had for all her children, now departed from her, was concentrated
on Bertram who had come back for a little while.
She could hardly bear him out of her sight, and often, when
he went up to his room he heard her quiet footsteps outside
the door. She was listening to his movements, standing
near him, though outside the room. She was happy, or
almost happy if he sat with her, holding her hand, or if she
could watch him from the other side of the fireplace, while
he sat back in a low chair, pretending to read the paper,
and thinking, thinking of Joyce, and his loneliness, and
what the devil to do with his life. Never quite happy, for
always in her heart was grief over the exile of Dorothy in
her German home, and anxiety about Susan who only sent
post card messages from Dublin, saying nothing, and fearfulness
on behalf of young Digby in the midst of civil war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a dreadful world, Bertram,” she said, once. “As
a young wife I was so happy with all my babies, and never
dreamed of all the horror ahead—war, revolutions, famines,
plague, endless strife. If only Queen Victoria could have
gone on living, we might have been saved all that. She
kept things safe by her virtue and wisdom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram tried hard not to laugh, yet he laughed aloud at
the idea of the poor old Queen “keeping things safe” in a
world that was making ready for convulsion even in her
time, by great natural moving forces that no mortal could
restrain; not King Canute with the advancing tide, nor
Queen Victoria in a changing era.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you laugh at me?” asked Mrs. Pollard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He patted her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You still belong to the Victorian Age!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We felt safe in that time,” said his mother. “Now I
don’t know what new terror will happen from day to day.
There’s an awful uncertainty, everywhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Reality breaking through Illusion,” said Bertram;
but his mother, as he saw, did not understand him, and he
did not try to make her understand. He was pitiful because
of the troubles that had overtaken her in the last
phase of her beautiful and faithful life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tears came into her eyes when he told her that he was
spending the evening away from home. He had promised
to call round again at Janet Welford’s flat in Battersea
Park.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it’s dull here alone with me,” said Mrs. Pollard,
“but you hardly know the comfort it gives me to see you
back again, now all my other dear birds have gone from the
nest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never dull with you, little mother,” he said, bending to
kiss her forehead. “But I like to see my friends at times.
I’ll be back before you go to bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he stayed rather late with Janet, and wasn’t back
until his mother had tired of waiting. She heard his step
passing her door, and called out, “Good night, my dear!”</p>

<div><h1>XXX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Janet Welford—“Janet Rockingham Welford” of
fiction fame—was a source of comfort to Bertram at
this time. She had a courage regarding life, a natural and
unaffected buoyancy of character, whatever might happen
in a world of tragedy, which shook him out of his morbid
brooding while he was in her company. She carried over
the audacity of her war-time spirit, when for a while she
had driven an ambulance into the Belgian zone of fire, to
that after-war period when most men and women felt
drained of vitality, and suffered miserable reaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was, perhaps, her daily service to the blinded men of
St. Dunstan’s which kept her soul tuned to the old key of
“carry on!” which had inspired masses of people during
the years of conflict so that they forgot, or put on one side,
their own griefs and cares, because of the great sufferings
of others, and the common need of sacrifice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was her explanation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My blinded boys keep me healthy and vital and brave,”
she smiled. “How the devil can I indulge in the megrims,
sit down and sob over my woes of thwarted passion, gloom
over the possible downfall of civilisation, or six shillings
in the pound for income tax, when those blind boys have
to be kept merry and bright to save them from despair and
suicide? They just knock one’s egotism stone dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s splendid of you!” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet wouldn’t allow any kind of splendour to herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Punk! It’s only another form of selfishness. They’re
my soul-cure. If I didn’t laugh for their sakes, make up
the most ridiculous and risky stories, to get a smile out
of them, coerce myself to look on the bright side of life,
so that I can reflect some sunshine into their sightless eyes,
I should probably suffer from sex-complexes or other
forms of beastliness. I serve them to save myself. That’s
what I tell them, and they think it an excellent joke. ‘Have
we done you good this morning, Miss?’ they ask, and I
say, ‘You’re my Salvation Army, my lads!’ and that keeps
us laughing round Regent’s Park.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram wondered sometimes whether Janet’s philosophy
was not founded on tremendous pessimism rather than on
unbounded optimism. A queer thought! Yet he had seen
that kind of psychology working out to the same result, in
France and Flanders, among the civilian folk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>French girls who had seen their little homesteads go up
in fire under the enemy’s guns, peasants who had lost everything
in the world, except life, by the invasion of the
“Boche,” women who had lost fathers, husbands, lovers,
brothers, acquired an astonishing serenity, even a gaiety
of mind. Nothing seemed to matter to them now. Death
itself was a “bagatelle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had seen girls laughing as though at some fantastic
joke, when they poked about the ruins of their cottages and
found bits of old furniture, the wheel of a baby’s perambulator,
the relic of some old familiar thing. It seemed to
give life a different sense of proportion, annihilating its
vanities, its greeds, its fears, its illusions. They were down
to the bed-rock of frightful realities, and nothing worse
could happen to them, and they were all “in the basket”
together. Their fate was no worse, and perhaps a little
better, than that of their neighbours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, in a way, it was with Janet. At least, he sometimes
thought so. Her father, and then her young brother, had
been killed in the war. Her mother had died of the anguish
of these shocks. She herself had spent the years of war
nursing mutilated men. It gave her that strange serenity
of vision which for a time had come to many of those
most stricken by war, though afterwards, when peace came,
they collapsed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hadn’t collapsed. It seemed simply silly to Janet
that English people should worry because trade was bad,
and get alarmed about the prospect of social revolution, or
excite themselves about the downfall of exchanges. She
stared forward to the future with audacious vision, and
demanded not a hark back to the old standards of comfort
and tradition, but root and branch changes, bold experiments
in social legislation, tremendous endeavours towards
the building of a new world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anyhow, she was not afraid. Not of Bolshevism, not of
poverty, not of any new tragedy that might emerge out of
the chaos of a Europe convulsed by the effects of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all frightfully interesting,” she said, “and, anyhow,
worry won’t stop the working out of Fate. Why be afraid
of Fate? We shall all be dead quite soon. Let’s play the
game out, and see it through, and pass the ball on to the
next players, when we’ve had our innings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That sounds good,” said Bertram, “but it doesn’t cure
the heart-ache of a woman left alone because her man was
killed in the war, or give any comfort to an unemployed
man, hanging about Labour Exchanges in search of jobs
that aren’t there. Your philosophy of devil-may-care won’t
stop another bout of massacre in Europe if the Old Gang
are allowed to play the fool again, or save the next generation
of boys from being blown to bits in lousy trenches. We
<span class='it'>must</span> worry. It’s our duty to worry and find a scientific
way of escape from all this madness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t call that worrying,” she answered. “I call that
thinking straight and acting with courage. That’s our point
of view in the ‘Left Wing.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Lord!” said Bertram, “Your parlour Bolsheviks
think all crooked, and have no more courage than lop-eared
rabbits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet laughed without a trace of annoyance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some of them are disgusting little egoists,” she admitted.
“But, anyhow, they’re educating themselves, and frightening
the Reactionaries. I like to see the Enemy getting
scared.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She used the word “enemy” to represent the Tory crowd—Joyce’s
crowd—more especially the Countess of Ottery’s
audience at the Wigmore Hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These political conversations ranged over wide fields of
discussion, and Bertram seemed to amuse Janet by his efforts
to moderate her extreme views. She became more
violent to tease him into argument, and when he called her
a Jacobin, who would knit below the scaffold when heads
were falling, she retaliated by calling him a Girondin who
would try to make revolutions with rose-water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this talk seemed to have relation to things happening,
or likely to happen, away beyond Battersea Park,
through the length and breadth of England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Coal Strike had begun. The railways had cut down
their service of trains to a bare minimum. Factories were
closing down in all the industrial towns. Millions of men
were idle and living on strike pay. The Army Reserve had
been called out, the Middle Classes were being recruited
under the scheme of General Bellasis, and the Miners were
in daily conference with the Engineers and Transport
Workers, who were discussing the question of a general
strike. If the “Triple Alliance” voted for that, not a wheel
would turn in England, and civil strife would certainly
break out, unless something like a miracle intervened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far no violence had happened. The miners had come
up from the pits, and were whitewashing their cottages.
They had made a fatal mistake already, alienating public
opinion, which, until then had been steadily in favour of
their side of the argument. The Pump men had been withdrawn
from the pits, and some of the mines were already
being flooded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A logical act,” said Janet. “The Pump men received
their lock-out notices with the others. The mine-owners
must take the responsibility.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rotten tactics and bad morality,” said Bertram. “The
men ought to safeguard their own means of life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they argued, as all other men and women in England
then, in every household where opinions differed on one
side or the other, and where there was a sense of imminent
disaster to the old foundations of civil life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But of more intimate and poignant interest to Bertram
was Janet’s frank talk about his private disaster—the
failure of his marriage. She had asked blunt questions
about his relations with Joyce, amazingly indiscreet and
fearless questions, and after fencing with them awhile, he
had told her the truth of things, with reticence and reservations,
and a sense of loyalty to Joyce, so that he put down
most of the cause of failure to his own stupidity and lack of
patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet listened, cross-examined, probed his mental wound,
with the skill and ruthlessness of a psychoanalyst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very interesting!” she remarked, more than once, like
a doctor diagnosing a difficult case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The inevitable clash of opposed temperaments,” was
another remark of hers, delivered with an air of superior
wisdom, and an amusement which she did not try to conceal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not very sympathetic!” complained Bertram.
“Not very helpful. What’s my way out of this mess?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet said, “Forget it. Shove it away into your subconsciousness,
and go on as though it didn’t exist. You’ll
find that it all straightens out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave him the benefit of her diagnosis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a case of sex-repression on your side, and of fear-complex
on your wife’s side. Yours is a simple case. Perfectly
ordinary. Nothing to worry about. Your wife’s
case is more complicated.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In response to Bertram’s plea for enlightenment, and his
heated protest that he <span class='it'>was</span> worrying, most damnably, Janet
elaborated a thesis regarding Joyce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram’s wife, she said, was the victim of an early environment
which had caused abnormality. She’d been sheltered
since babyhood from all contact with the realities of
life. She was never allowed to speak with “common people”
on equal terms. They’d pulled their forelocks to “the
little lady” when she had passed in her perambulator.
They’d curtsied at the lodge gates every time she went in
and out. She was made to believe that she was superior
to the rest of the world, with the exception of other people
like herself, who lived in other houses like Holme Ottery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rest of mankind, to her child mind, was entirely
taken up with the duty and honour and delight of providing
a pleasant life to those born in the higher sphere—mowing
the lawns, grooming the horses, clipping the hedges, polishing
the floors, waiting at table, bowing silently when rebuked
however unjustly, utterly dependent upon Lady
Joyce Bellairs and her exalted family. She’d had no notion,
as a child, that outside the parkland of Holme Ottery
the world had moved on. The portraits of her ancestors in
their silks and laces seemed to prove that her world, and
theirs, had always been the same, and always would be,
sheltered, protected, served, admired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the war had come, breaking through the quietude of
Holme Ottery, but not, for a while, smashing the old illusions.
Joyce’s father had still played the great game of
ruling the county as Lord Lieutenant. Alban had played
the diplomatic game in the Foreign Office. Joyce’s friends
had been officers, saluted by all men as they passed, holding
authority even more firmly than of old.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was only after the war that Joyce had been frightened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She saw that Holme Ottery and all that it meant was
threatened, that stupendous taxation was killing the old
way of life for people like herself, destroying their sense
of security, their power, their pleasaunces. And she had
become aware of other perils; the bogey of Bolshevism, social
“unrest,” a new insolence of men back from the war,
no longer quick to pull their forelocks when the lady passed,
but talking bitterly about their “rights,” their claim to work,
and a living wage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce Bellairs was afraid of brutal forces threatening
all that she had loved as a child, all that she had believed
as a child. Her behaviour to Bertram was on account of
that. It was a fear-complex. She loved him, but the very
strength of her love made her brutal to him when he seemed
to ally himself with the powers that made her afraid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It sounds all right,” said Bertram, listening a little impatiently,
“but it’s all wrong! Joyce doesn’t understand
fear. She has more than the courage of men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Physical courage, yes. Not mental courage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Besides,” said Bertram, “that doesn’t solve my problem.
How am I going to live a single life, apart from Joyce,
who is still my wife? How am I going to persuade her to
withdraw that word ‘traitor’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give her time, and don’t worry,” was Janet’s answer
to his conundrum. “A little separation will do you both
good. Heavens alive! The constant companionship of
marriage would be a strain on two archangels. I couldn’t
bear it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve borne my company patiently for three evenings
a week,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but not for three breakfasts! It’s breakfast that’s
the test of love. Most people break over it, like boiled
eggs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram wasn’t sure how far Janet’s talk was sincere,
how much she believed in her own absurdities. Perhaps
she was behaving to him as she did to her blinded men,
talking “any old thing”—to get a laugh out of them, to
“keep their pecker up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He accused her of that once, and she blushed a little, as
though found guilty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made her blush another time, when he spoke of
Christy’s love for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you know Christy worships you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She veiled her eyes with her long brown lashes, and
said, “Yes, I know.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Poor dear old Plesiosaurus!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you fix it up with him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little smile played about her lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘He’s never asked me, sir, she said.’ And, besides, I
haven’t told you that I requite his gloomy passion!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s one of the best in the world,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She agreed, but said that the best were almost as difficult
as the worst when it came to board and breakfast with
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t you human?” asked Bertram, half jestingly, half
in earnest. “Don’t you need love, and the passion of life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She talked so frankly to him that he could speak like that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That doubt about her humanity amused her exceedingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Man!” she cried, “I’m a living Cleopatra without her
Antony! If I were to ease up an instant on blinded men,
political meetings, ‘Left Wing’ committees, audacious
novels, and all manner of work, goodness knows what I
should do in the way of amorous adventure. I go in for
what the psychoanalysts call the sublimation of sex.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the deuce is that?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Transferring the emotion to intellectual aims. Producing
books instead of babies. Reforming society instead of
yearning for a kiss. Keeping busy on foolish, futile things,
instead of wasting one’s energy in amorous dalliance.
That’s my advice to you, young fellow! Cut out the emotional
stuff for a time. Forget Joyce and marriage, and
all this morbid love-agony. Life’s bigger than that. It’s
only a little messy side of life. We make too much fuss
about it, exaggerate the importance of the damn thing by
always thinking and writing and talking about it. Go and
make a revolution somewhere, or lead an expedition to find
the living Megatherium, or write a book to ‘bust’ the falsity
of things, or cut down trees in Canada, or convert cannibals
to Christianity, or Christians to a decent code of honour,
or make some plan for a higher civilisation, or some plan
for destroying the civilisation we have—any good, straight,
clean, manly job that’s not mixed up with the eternal soppy
and sickly question of love and Louisa. Give it a miss, O
Knight of the Rueful Countenance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Human nature is human nature. It doesn’t give one
any peace that way. It keeps on nagging.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let it nag. Crush the little devil down. Say,
‘Avaunt, you vampire!’ Look at me! A Cleopatra, yet
beyond reproach, as Cæsar’s wife!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She cheered him. There was something in her point
of view. He must put the problem of Joyce out of his
mind and heart as far as possible. Get busy! Well, he
was writing some more articles for <span class='it'>The New World</span>. They
helped him to forget.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet this girl, Janet, so gay, so kind, so wise, even in
spite of her extravagance of thought and speech, was beginning
to trouble him in the very way he wished to avoid,
in the very way she derided and denounced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She troubled him one night when she said suddenly,
“A pity, Sir Faithful, that you didn’t marry me instead of
Joyce! I understand you better. We think more on the
same line. And you were my first Dream Knight, in the
days when you kissed me in Kensington Gardens.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was just like her to come out with a startling thing
like that, in a matter-of-fact way, as though it were nothing
out of the ordinary, and undisturbing. He was strangely
disturbed, and hardly knew what to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too late now!” was all he could say, and then laughed
uneasily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She troubled him again by the way she used to sit on a
little low stool by his side when they were alone together in
the evening or even when Katherine Wild was with them,
leaning her head against his knees. He liked it very much
because it was so comradely and sisterly, but he was human
and separated from his wife, and not a disembodied spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was troubled more than all one night when he was
leaving her and she put her face up to be kissed and said,
“A chaste salute, Sir Faithful? Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He kissed her, and it was good in his loneliness. And
yet not good in his conscience. For he had faith and
loyalty, to Joyce who was his wife, though unkind to him,
and to Christy who was his friend, and the lover of this
girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he went back to his mother’s house in Sloane Street,
he spoke aloud the old catchword which was his usual comment
on life:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all very difficult!”</p>

<div><h1>XXXI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>A thunderbolt struck the house in Sloane Street
at half past eight one morning. It came, as other
bolts had fallen upon men’s and women’s hearts during the
time of the Great War, in a little pink envelope. This one
was addressed to Bertram Pollard, and it came from Dublin.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Dennis condemned to death execution Wednesday. Implore
father’s influence. Susan.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram was sitting at breakfast opposite her father, who
was reading <span class='it'>The Morning Post</span> as usual at this meal. His
mother was pouring out coffee, and was aware instantly of
his sudden indrawing of breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Bertram!” she said, in a low voice. “Is it bad
news?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She slopped some coffee from the pot over the edge of
a cup.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was tempted to lie to her and say “Nothing much!
A business matter,” but before the words left his lips he
knew that honesty was best. She had seen his look of dismay,
if he prevaricated, she would guess that the news was
worse than this, though this was bad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not good,” he said. “It’s about Susan’s husband.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That young scoundrel!” said his father, glancing over
the top of his paper; “what infamy is he mixed up in now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram read out the telegram, and saw his mother’s face
change to a new tone of pallor, and the look of anguish
in her eyes for Susan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Implore father’s influence.’ ” These words caused his
father to drop <span class='it'>The Morning Post</span> in which he was reading
a terrific indictment of Sinn Fein with a sense of fierce
enjoyment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t use a hairsbreadth of influence to save my
own son from the hangman’s rope, if he were a Sinn Fein
murderer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s your own daughter’s husband,” said Bertram.
“The relationship is fairly close.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too close,” said Michael Pollard. “Susan dishonoured
her name by that secret and shameful marriage. I’ll never
forgive her. I’ve already given orders that her name will
not be mentioned in my presence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He picked up the paper again, and pretended to read, very
calmly. But his hands trembled, so that the paper rustled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear!” said Mrs. Pollard; “for our dear Susan’s
sake, I implore you, as she implores you. I’ve been a faithful
wife to you. I beg you now to use any power you have
in a plea of mercy for that misguided boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had risen from her chair, and Bertram saw that she
was more excited than he had ever seen her. She had a
tragic look, and age had crept into her face suddenly, so
that she seemed an old, old lady, very frail and broken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father lowered his paper again, and he too was
startled, it seemed to Bertram, by his wife’s look and speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My darling,” he said, “trouble falls heavily upon your
poor soul, because of our children’s folly. But I can do
nothing in this matter, even if I would. If the fellow has
been condemned by court-martial, it’s clear that he’s guilty
of murder. He must suffer the punishment of murderers.
No power of mine can save him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can have an enquiry made. At least postpone this
dreadful sentence! Michael, if you have any love for me,
in my old age, and my weakness—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She faltered forward to him, and would have fallen if
Bertram had not sprung towards her and held her close.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother! Courage!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My poor Susan!” she cried. “My dear little daughter!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Pollard rose, pale now, like his wife, visibly distressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll see if there’s anything to be done,” he said. “I’ll
make enquiry. Hush, Mother! Hush, now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put her hand on his shoulder and wept miserably, and
said, “For God’s sake, dear. I can’t bear it! This is the
worst that’s happened yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram took her to the sitting-room, and left her there
later, when she seemed more composed, though still trembling.
He went to his father’s study, and entered without
knocking, and saw his father standing with his hands behind
his back, staring at the floor with a heavy frown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father,” he said, “something’s got to be done about
this. You must get to work quickly. It’s not long till
Wednesday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Michael Pollard stared at his son with anger and suspicion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much do you know about this?” he asked. “Did
Susan tell you how many murders her precious husband
has committed? How many of your fellow officers he has
shot in cold blood?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know nothing,” said Bertram. “Don’t talk to me,
father, as if I were an accomplice of Dennis O’Brien.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re sympathetic with Sinn Fein,” said his father.
“You sheltered this very man in your own house, I’m told.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram wondered how he knew as much as that, but
didn’t ask.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was with me an hour or two. Susan brought him.
But that’s nothing to the point. For mother’s sake you
must do what’s possible, and quickly, sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s nothing possible,” said Mr. Pollard. “I know
all about the case already. This man O’Brien has been
found guilty of leading an ambush against British officers,
two of whom were killed. He was captured on the spot, a
week ago, tried yesterday, and condemned. I have the full
report.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he knew before the telegram came! He had not
thought it worth while to tell Bertram before or to guard
his wife against the shock of the news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram begged him to put in a plea for mercy. It
wouldn’t be ignored, because of his name and service to
the Government. It might save O’Brien’s life, at least, and
Susan’s life-long misery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Michael Pollard’s face hardened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I speak to you more frankly, Bertram, than to your poor
mother. For her sake I’ve already done as much as I can
in honour. I’ve enquired into the proofs of guilt, into the
Court Martial procedure. There’s no doubt of guilt, no flaw
in the conduct of the trial. The Chief Secretary has favoured
me with a private consultation. I told him, as I tell
you, that I wish for no mercy on behalf of an Irish rebel
who has fired on forces of the Crown, and killed men in
British uniform.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram groaned, and quoted, not lightly, but in anguish,
the old Shakespearean line,</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“The quality of mercy is not strained.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“Sinn Fein has no mercy,” said his father. “It’s ruthless
and bloody and cruel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Need we meet cruelty by cruelty?” asked Bertram.
“Wouldn’t chivalry gain more for us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never!” answered his father harshly. “The Irish
Catholics don’t understand the meaning of chivalry. These
Sinn Feiners would stab a man in the back who held out
his hand in friendship and forgiveness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re Irish of the Irish!” said Bertram. “Your Irish
blood is in my veins. We of all people should understand
the passion of our race for liberty, their remembrance of
old crimes against their faith and land, their frightful heritage
of memory. I loathe this guerrilla warfare, but I
understand its motives and impulses. In their spirit it’s
as much a fight for liberty as that of any people who strive
to free themselves from a foreign yoke. O’Brien’s deed
was not real murder, at least in his soul and conscience, because
it was an act of war—armed men against armed men,
and ours with no right in Ireland, except that of ancient
conquest. Surely there’s a difference. Surely as an Irishman,
you see there’s no moral baseness in what O’Brien did?
Except the madness of argument by blood and force for an
ideal of liberty which might be gained by other means.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every word you say convinces me that you’re on the
side of the rebels,” said Michael Pollard. “You’re a traitor
in my own household. I’ll be glad when you leave my house
before I have to turn you out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the second time that Bertram had been called
traitor. Once it was his wife who called him that. Now
it was his father. He went white to the lips at the sound
of it, and that last sentence of his father’s put passion into
his brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did God make you without humanity?” he asked. “Is
it for nothing that you’ve lost the love of all your children
and now risk the love of the woman who bore them, and is
stricken by your harshness in her old age?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Michael Pollard’s face became ashen in colour at these
words from his son. He took a step forward, and then
raised his hand sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silence, sir! I have one son who is a comfort to me,
and to his mother. Digby does his duty and is loyal. I
find no loyalty in you. I don’t wish to hear more of your
rebellious insolence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you refuse to raise a little finger to help Susan in
her grief, or mother in her agony?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father turned from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave my room!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram left the room, and that night crossed over to
Ireland from Holyhead. In his mind was the thought of
three other people stricken by this tragedy—those three
sisters of Dennis O’Brien, who would be weeping for him
now, and praying still to God, who didn’t answer their
prayers. The youngest of them—Jane—had said, “What’ll
I do if Dennis is taken from us?” She’d had a foreboding
of his fate, perhaps a knowledge of his guilt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Guilt it was. Bertram sickened at the thought of that
guerrilla warfare which he had tried to defend to his father,
but couldn’t defend in his heart because of loyalty to England
and hatred of cruelty. It was all madness and murder,
though with some spiritual value behind it, and not ignoble
passion. Those young men, mostly boys, who fought for
Irish liberty, were willing to die for Ireland, went to their
death on the scaffold like martyrs. Yet they adopted
methods of war which were Red Indian in their savagery.
On the other side, the British Government had abandoned
all sanity, all statesmanship, all decency. By a series of
stupidities, falsities, betrayal of pledges, they had maddened
Irish manhood into this state of rebellion—at least had reopened
old wounds, and revived old passions. Now they
could find no other policy than that of coercion, meeting
Terror by Counter-Terror, trying to break the spirit of the
Irish people by raids, searches, shootings, burnings. God!
What a horror, after the Great War! And what a mental
agony for a man like himself, hating the methods of both
sides, seeing the point of view from both sides, divided in
sympathy, trying to keep to the middle of the road, between
the two extremes. Once again he was called traitor, and
felt the word like a wound in his heart. Traitor, though he
was loyal to the truth as far as he could see it. Traitor,
though he had pledged his soul to loyalty!</p>

<div><h1>XXXII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>It was a rough passage from Holyhead, and he felt sick
in the smoking saloon, crowded with officers of the
Royal Scots, among whom, silent and absorbed in thought
or prayer, sat two Irish priests. There was a battalion of
soldiers on board—mostly boys of nineteen or so—and most
of them were horribly sick as they lay among their kit and
rifles. They cursed Ireland, the War Office, Lloyd George,
and other powers which had ordained this night passage
across the Irish Channel and the “bloody job” at the end
of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram spoke a few words to one of the officers, a captain
with a row of decorations. He had been on service in
Ireland before, and was going back from leave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s it like over there?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like nothing on earth,” said the officer. “Worse than
France, barring barrage-fire. One never knows when one
is going to be sniped, or blown up by a bomb thrown from
a side street. Not a gentleman’s job! A rotten dirty
business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s going to be the end of it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young officer shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ll go on with this guerrilla game for centuries,
unless we wipe out the whole lot. Another Cromwell show!
Of course, I’m not supposed to hold opinions, but speaking
privately, I’d give them anything less than a Republic, clear
out British troops, and let them stew in their own juice.
They’d fight like Hell among themselves. That would make
less Irish in the world, and save a lot of trouble. What’s
your view?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram’s view was much the same, with regard to
“clearing out,” though he believed they wouldn’t go in for
civil war among themselves if they had Dominion Home
Rule.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t know them,” said the Captain of Royal Scots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m half Irish,” Bertram told him, and the officer said,
“Oh!” suspiciously, and after that was silent and moved
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The railway journey to North Wall was uneventful.
The line was guarded by troops, and there were many soldiers
in the train, wearing steel hats and full fighting kit.
Boys again, sullen-looking, and with shifty, nervous eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Dublin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram walked through the streets like a <span class='it'>revenant</span>.
Dublin belonged to a former life. He had forgotten it for
a thousand years—or was it only sixteen? He found his
way to Merrion Square, and stood outside his father’s old
home—Number 23—and gazed up at its windows through
dirty lace curtains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inside one of those rooms he had first seen the light of
day. Half-forgotten incidents of his childhood came back
to him, vividly, with astonishing sharpness of detail. He
remembered putting his head once through those railings
and not being able to get it out again. That was when he
was four years old, or thereabouts. Good Heavens! There
were two of the railings bent, where his Irish nurse had
pressed them apart with a cry of “Holy Mother of God!”
Betty was her name. He remembered now. And there was
the ring and wrought iron lion’s head of the door-knocker
which he had just been able to reach on tip-toe, later in
that early life of his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He remembered “the Move”—the frightful excitement of
it—when, at nine years of age, he had left this house with
all the family, for England. He had wept bitterly at leaving,
especially when his broken rocking-horse had been cast
on to the scrap heap, with other wreckage of nursery life.
He could remember the mangy tuft of hair on that wooden
beast, and the smell of red paint which had once represented
a saddle. He had kissed its wooden nose, and howled when
it was taken from him for ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty had frightened him about England. “The English
will skin you alive if you make a noise in their London
town.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The English know nothing but hate for the
Irish.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The English are a bad-tempered set of spalpeens,
and there’s no truth in them at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dublin! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was strange to be here among his own
people, a foreigner among them. He had the English way
of speech, the English way of mind. Some of them, especially
the young men, scowled at him as he passed down
Sackville Street. They knew him as English by the cut
of his clothes, by the look in his eyes. They didn’t see the
Irish strain of blood in him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at their faces as they pushed by. What was
wrong with them? They were people haunted by some
hidden fear. There was fear in their eyes. They kept
glancing about them, uneasily, watchfully. Some men were
nailing boards outside a shop window, and one of the planks
fell on to the pavement with a slight crash. Instantly a
group of people gathered round a shop window scattered
and ran into neighbouring doorways. The men with the
boards laughed. One of them called out, “No danger at
all, at all!”—and in a moment or two men and women
emerged from shelter, smiled at each other, and went their
way again, with that nervous glance to left and right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Haunted! Yes, that was the word. Many of the women
had haggard eyes, drawn, pallid faces, little lines of pain
about their mouths. They looked as though they had lost
their sleep for nights or weeks. Their nerves were tattered.
It was easy to see that by their sudden shrinking from any
little noise, like the crack of a jarvey’s whip, or a boy’s
shrill whistle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They greeted each other like women Bertram had seen in
French villages after mornings of great battle when the
wounded had gone streaming by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear God!” said one woman to another as he passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother of Mercy!” said another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no mystery about it. Here, in Sackville Street
were outward and visible signs of conflict, old and recent;
the ruins of the Post Office and public buildings bombarded
during the Rebellion of Easter Week in ’16, and new bulletmarks
on the walls of shops, and through plate-glass windows.
Many shops were barricaded. Others were shut up
and barred. Women did their shopping through narrow
entrances of stacked timber. It was a city of Civil War.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Worse than Civil War, thought Bertram, for here there
was no knowing who was friend and who enemy. Any of
these young Irishmen strolling by might have a bomb in
his pocket, and hurl it at any man he had marked down,
rightly or wrongly, as a spy, a detective, a Government
official, a British officer in mufti. From any window or
any roof might come the crack of a sniper’s bullet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An armoured car passed, with its machine guns poking
through the loop-holes, and people stared at it sullenly or
fell back on the sidewalks as it went by. Many of them
ran quickly into side streets when a lorry full of soldiers
came at a rapid speed down the street. It was covered
with a wired cage in which young soldiers wearing steel
hats, like those boys with whom Bertram had crossed, sat
with rifles on their knees, looking down on the crowd in
Sackville Street with unfriendly eyes, smiling ironically
when they saw them running.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dublin in time of Peace, after the Great War! In that
former life of Bertram’s—how many years ago?—it had
been a gay, careless old city, if he remembered well. Young
as he was, he had walked up that very street alone, or hand
in hand with Susan, without any fear, or sense of peril.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somewhere in the city was Susan now, weeping because
the man she loved was to be hanged on Wednesday morning,
which was next day. He must find her, and stand by
her in this time of trouble. But first he must find Digby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was to find Digby that Bertram had come to Dublin.
He had a last wild hope that Digby might help to get a
reprieve for Dennis O’Brien. A word from him to his commanding
officer, from that officer to the Judge Advocate in
Dublin Castle, might have some result. The condemned
man was Digby’s brother-in-law, Michael Pollard’s son-in-law.
Surely, surely it might lead to mercy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Digby was in barracks somewhere on the north side of
the city. Bertram found the place by enquiring of a group
of soldiers, halted with stacked rifles in a street off Fitzwilliam
Square. They were suspicious at first, and would
not answer his questions. The sergeant went so far as to
tell him to “clear off, unless he wanted a hole through his
head.” He became civil and informative when Bertram
gave him his card, showing his old rank of major in the
British Army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry, sir! But we have to be careful. These damned
Irish—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The barracks where Digby was quartered were a good
mile away, and difficult to find. No good asking the passers-by,
and quite dangerous. They didn’t like people who paid
friendly visits to British barracks. He had better be careful,
walking alone. Not pleasant to be shot in the back of
the head!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sergeant drew a little map on the back of an envelope.
He seemed to know Dublin blindfold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve searched every street in that district. Two of my
lads were killed in Donegal Street, not two weeks ago. Not
a health resort in that quarter!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the map, Bertram found the barracks, and was glad
to get there. As he walked up dirty narrow streets where
“washing” was hanging out of the windows, sullen glances,
and sometimes foul words, greeted him from people lounging
in their doorways, or slouching by. A young girl spat
as he passed, as though he were a living stench. Two
youths with caps drawn over their eyes followed him a
little way, scowling when he turned to glance at them, and
searching him with suspicious eyes. They dropped back at
a corner saloon. A frowsy woman sitting on a doorstep
smoking a cutty pipe, while some bare-legged children
played about the street, raised her voice and cursed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May the divils of Hell strike you dead for an English
blackguard!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m as Irish as yourself, mother!” he answered her, not
liking the way in which windows began to open and heads
come out, at the sound of her shrill voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Irish are ye! Then why the divil d’ye look like an English
cut-throat? Holy Mother o’ God! May the English
soon be driven into the sea and all drowned with the spawn
of Hell!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the barrack gate, the sentry fell back with his bayonet
on guard. At the sight of an unknown civilian he looked
thoroughly scared, and the point of his bayonet trembled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right, my man,” said Bertram, in his best army
style. “I’m Major Bertram Pollard. I’ve come to see my
brother, Mr. Digby Pollard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No civilians allowed, sir,” said the man. “Nobody in
civil clothes,” he added, as a concession to Bertram’s rank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Send a message up to the O.C. It’s important.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The message was sent, and an orderly came down to take
him to Colonel Lavington. It appeared that Digby was out
on a search party and would not be back until the following
day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry!” said the Colonel pleasantly. “Anything I can
do for you, Major?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram was utterly depressed by this stroke of evil luck.
By the time Digby came back, O’Brien’s execution would
have happened. He revealed the tragedy of his mission
to the Colonel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m here on a forlorn hope, sir,” he said. “It’s to make
a plea for a man condemned to death. My sister’s husband,
Dennis O’Brien.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Colonel Lavington sat up in his chair, and did not hide
his surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That man O’Brien! Your brother-in-law?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t my brother Digby tell you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a word!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Colonel was sympathetic. He made no concealment
of his hatred of the whole show in Ireland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ought not to say so—I’m a Regular, you know!—but
the politicians in England seem to be bungling frightfully.
I don’t approve of these executions. They only inflame
passion still further, and make martyrs of the condemned
men. The scenes that go on round the prison on the morning
of execution are hair-raising!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no doubt about Dennis O’Brien’s guilt. He
had been captured in the ambush, after shooting a British
officer—poor young Stewart-MacKey. He’d been tried by
Court Martial and condemned to death for murder. Of
course, in a way, it wasn’t murder. The Irish argued that
men captured like that ought to be treated as prisoners of
war. As a soldier, he saw something in that. Still, as long
as the present policy continued, he could not criticise. It
was all a dirty business. Dreadful! Worse than war!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would ring up the Judge Advocate. He might go as
far as that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram listened while he “rang up.” He listened with
a sense of Fate in the disjointed words spoken at last over
that little instrument in a white-washed room furnished
with a table, two chairs, and a map of Dublin on the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that the Judge Advocate? Oh, Colonel Lavington
speaking. About that man, Dennis O’Brien, in Mountjoy
Prison. Yes, to be hanged to-morrow morning. Yes. I
have his brother-in-law here, Major Bertram Pollard, son
of Michael Pollard, M.P. His brother-in-law. Yes. You
knew? Telegrams from London? Oh, yes, special report!
Well, then, you don’t think—No. Not a chance? Must
take place? Reprieve impossible? I understand, sir. Yes.
Yes. Sorry to have troubled you. Oh, of course. At six
o’clock to-morrow? Thanks. Quite so. Yes, Major Pollard’s
with me now. Yes. I’ll explain. Your regrets?
Yes. Thanks again, sir. All right. Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a chance?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Judge Advocate had explained fully. Bertram could
hear the crackle of his voice on the telephone. The
Colonel’s words had been said between long bouts of speech
from the Judge Advocate—that hoarse crackling in the receiver
of the instrument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. You understood by my answers? The Judge Advocate
has been in communication with the Chief Secretary
about the case. It has been thoroughly considered. Their
decision is definite. Justice must take its course, and so
on. Well! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’m extremely sorry for your sake, and for
your sister’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was wonderfully courteous, charmingly sympathetic,
not at all a Black and Tan in his political opinions, but it
would make no difference to Dennis O’Brien.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The execution was at six o’clock? Yes, at Mountjoy
Prison. There would be strong guards outside. Sure to
be a public demonstration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram thanked Colonel Lavington, gave him the latest
news about the English Strike, shook hands, and went. His
coming to Ireland had been in vain. He might as well
have remained in London, except for the knowledge that
he had done his best, for Susan’s sake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had no idea where his sister was living in the city,
and perhaps it was better so. What could he say to her?
How could he give her any comfort?</p>

<div><h1>XXXIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>That night he slept a little in his chair in a bedroom
of the Shelbourne Hotel. At four o’clock in the
morning he awakened, cramped and chilled. It was the
morning of execution. Something called to him to go out
to Mountjoy Prison, though overnight he had no such intention.
“The scenes that go on round the prison are hair-raising,”
said the Colonel. What kind of scenes? He
would go and see for himself. It would help him to understand
the spirit of the Irish people, the spirit of half his
own blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found a jaunting car, and bargained with the jarvey
to take him to the prison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re hanging Dennis O’Brien,” said the man. “God’s
curse on them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All round the prison were strong forces of troops. Several
armoured cars were drawn up, and a search-light was
turned on a dense black crowd of people waiting there
through the night, for the coming of dawn. They were
mostly women and young girls, with shawls over their
heads. Some bareheaded, some well-dressed with hats of
the latest style. They were of all classes and ages, and with
them were some priests who moved about among them,
leading the recitation of the Rosary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again and again, with endless repetition, the crowd,
kneeling on the cobble-stones, murmured their prayer:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Hail, Mary, full of grace,</p>
<p class='line0'>The Lord is with thee,</p>
<p class='line0'>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>
<p class='line0'>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>
<p class='line0'>Holy Mary, Mother of God,</p>
<p class='line0'>Pray for us sinners</p>
<p class='line0'>Now and at the hour of our death,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Amen</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Between each prayer there rose another sound, the
strangest, most terrible sound of a human kind that Bertram
had ever heard beyond a battlefield. It was the wailing
of women. It was like the cry of the Banshee, as he
had imagined it with horror in childhood. It rose and fell
in rhythmic anguish, from all those shawl-covered women,
kneeling with bowed heads, or raising their heads and hands
like a Greek chorus, to the heavens above. The search-light
moved above them, touched their white hands,
searched along the line of upturned faces, seemed to search
their souls and reveal their passion. Between the “decades”
of the Rosary, and the wail of the women, other voices
rose, crying out ejaculatory prayers and sacred names.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Holy Mother o’ God! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Sweet Jesus, have mercy on
him! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Christ be with him to the end! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Saint Joseph,
comfort him! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. God help him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The soldiers in their shrapnel helmets and field kit stood
motionless. Their helmets—the old “tin hats” of France
and Flanders,—were touched at times by the white finger
of light, and their faces were sharply illumined in those
moments. Young, square-jawed, English faces. Now and
again one of them pushed back some one in the crowd with
the butt-end of his rifle, sharply, but without brutality. An
officer passed down their lines, occasionally spoke a word
of command. Bertram was edged amidst a group of
women. When they knelt, he felt himself isolated and too
prominent, as the only man among them, and standing. He
decided to kneel, and he too bowed his head when the
prayers rose again for a soul shortly to be hurled into
eternity at the end of a hangman’s rope. Frightful thought!
That man had been a comrade of his in the war. They had
touched hands. Only a few weeks ago he had sat in Bertram’s
study in Holland Street with Susan, his young wife,
Bertram’s sister. Now this!</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Holy Mary, Mother o’ God,</p>

</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>For the hundredth or thousandth time the words of the
Rosary came from the kneeling crowd. A woman close to
Bertram fell all huddled in a faint on the cold stones. Other
women bent over her, loosened her shawl. A girl was sobbing
loudly, with her face in her hands. A boy—a mere
child—ended his prayer with a curse. “To Hell with
England!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somewhere, perhaps, in the crowd was Susan, weeping
and praying for her man. When the search-light passed
Bertram stared closely at some of the women’s faces, but
did not see his sister, though more than once his heart gave
a thump because he thought some girl was like her. The
light of dawn crept into the sky, above the prison walls.
Presently a silver streak broke through the black clouds.
The crowd perceived it, and because the hour of execution
was coming near, the wail of the women rose louder, with
greater anguish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Christ have mercy on him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord have mercy on him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A bell began to toll. Bertram could see it wagging to
and fro in the turret of a chapel above the prison wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A priest stood up on a box, or some small platform, and
spoke some words to the crowd, which Bertram failed to
hear. Somewhere in the crowd a woman shrieked, and
then was hushed down. All heads were bowed, and a
dreadful hush came upon them for what seemed like a long
time to Bertram, before the patter of prayers rose again.
The dawn was creeping up, and the sky was grey, and rain
began to fall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram was conscious of stones cutting into his knees.
He was faint with hunger, and felt a little sick. He found
himself trembling, and a cold sweat broke upon his forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dennis O’Brien! Susan’s husband!</p>

<p class='pindent'>What year was this? 1921! Nineteen hundred and
twenty one years in the Christian era! After the Great
War.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Civilisation! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Peace! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Self-Determination
of Peoples! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Liberty! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What was Joyce
doing? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What was all this tragedy called Life? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Where was God? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Where was Susan in the crowd? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Oh, Christ!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The silver streak broadened, and the top of the prison
wall was clear cut against the sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bell tolled. A strange deep sigh came from the
crowd. The bell stopped tolling. Above the prison wall
a little black square fluttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A priest stood on the box again, and raised his hands,
and spoke some more words. Bertram heard the end of
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May the souls of the faithful departed, through the
mercy of God, rest in peace, Amen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another priest took his place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He died as a Christian martyr. His last words were,
‘God save Ireland’!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A frightful confusion of sound burst forth. No one was
kneeling now. The women had risen to their feet, some
wailing, some crying in shrill, fierce tones, some weeping
noisily, some laughing, even, as one girl near Bertram, with
hysteria. Men’s voices sounded among the women’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God save Ireland! To hell with England! May God
curse them for this day! The bloody tyrants!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As in a kind of liturgy, prayers answered the curses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May his soul rest in peace!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother of God, pray for him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The soldiers were turning back the crowd with their rifles
lengthwise. An officer shouted words of command. An
armoured car moved, driving a line among the women.
Bertram was pressed amidst a living mass, mostly women,
forced along with them. The tress of a woman’s hair,
uncoiled in the night, flicked across his face. Hands
grabbed at his shoulders for support. A girl swooned and
fell against him, and he put his arm about her and helped
to carry her. Presently, after a long while, as it seemed,
he found himself with elbow-room, able to walk freely,
following separate groups of men and women.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Sackville Street he came face to face with Susan. She
was walking with a girl on each side of her, one of whom
was Betty O’Brien, the sister of Dennis, who was hanged.
Their clothes were wet and bedraggled, their hair wild, like
all the women who had waited outside the prison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Susan!” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stared at him without recognition for a moment, and
then faltered forward, and clutched him, and wept with her
head against him. But not for long. Some other passion
shook her, not of grief but rage. She drew back from her
brother, and took Betty’s arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bertram,” she said, in a hoarse voice, “for what has
happened to-day I’ll never forgive England. I’m Sinn Fein
to the death. Body and soul of me for Ireland and liberty!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In her tear-stained eyes was a wild light. She looked
like a drunken woman of the streets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A crowd gathered about them, and an English officer
came up and said very politely, “Please pass away. Please
don’t make trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get away yourself,” said Betty O’Brien. “Out of Ireland
with all your tyranny!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must ask you to move on,” said the officer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram tried to induce Susan to give him her address,
but she refused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to be alone,” she said. “And you’re too English.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m your brother, and the same old pal,” said Bertram.
“I want to help you, little sister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put her hand on his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Help me by leaving me. Don’t you understand? I’ve
been through Hell’s torture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned away from him, down a side street, with
Betty and the other girl, and he did not follow her, because
he understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That morning in the Shelbourne Hotel, he was called up
on the telephone by Colonel Lavington.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that Major Pollard? Oh, good morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a moment’s silence, some hesitation on the telephone.
Then the Colonel spoke again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry to report bad news. Your brother Digby was
killed last night. A sniper’s bullet on the outskirts of
Dublin. A splendid young man. Most regrettable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most regrettable! It was the old phrase used in the Great
War when youth was killed. “I regret to report the loss
of your gallant son—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>How was Bertram to face his mother with the news?
How was he going to balance the tragedy of Dennis
O’Brien with the tragedy of Digby Pollard? How was he
going to get any sane judgment about this frightful orgy
of death and outrage, hangings and shootings, prayers and
curses and bleeding hearts?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Digby! That kid! A baby only a few years ago, to
whom he told fairy-tales as he lay in bed! Now dead by a
sniper’s bullet. What year of the Christian era? Yes,
1921! Bertram in his room at the Shelbourne laughed
aloud, harshly, and then wept.</p>

<div><h1>XXXIV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>One of the tragic moments of Bertram’s life, which
afterwards he could never remember without a
shadow darkening his mind, was when he entered his father’s
house after that visit to Dublin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His way back had been delayed by the Coal Strike. The
fast train from Holyhead was cancelled, and he had to come
by a slow train, crowded with men thrown out of work
by the shutting down of factories for lack of fuel. “It’s
the end of England if this lasts long,” said one of them,
but Bertram thought only of his journey’s end, and of his
meeting with his mother, now that Digby lay dead, with a
sniper’s bullet through his brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The news had come to her, he found, through a report
in <span class='it'>The Evening News</span>, confirmed, almost immediately, by
a telegram to his father from the Irish Secretary. Mrs.
Pollard was in her little sitting-room when Bertram arrived,
and tried to rise from her desk when he bent and
put his arms about her. She didn’t weep very much, except
for one brief agony of tears, but was quite broken. Over
and over again she spoke the name of the dead boy, her
last child, and said many times that she knew he was
doomed. She was almost too weak to walk across her
room, and complained that her heart had gone “queer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram carried her up to bed that evening, and sent for
a doctor, who looked grave, and told Bertram that his
mother was in a very feeble state of health, with a pulse
far below normal. Nothing organically wrong, except a
cardiac weakness, but general lack of vitality. She would
need constant attention, and he would send a trained nurse
round that night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram sat by his mother’s side before the nurse came
that evening. She clasped his hand almost like a child
afraid to be left alone in the dark, as once he had held hers.
Several times she seemed to be wandering in her mind,
wandering back to the early days of her motherhood, when
her children were young. She seemed to be worried because
Dorothy had torn her frock, and a little later, told
Bertram not to tease Susan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you hear me—?” she asked suddenly, after a long
silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram bent over her, and told her that he heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mustn’t tease little Susan,” she said. “You’re getting
a big boy now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she fell asleep, still clasping his hand, and he listened
to her breathing which seemed troubled, and sometimes
came with a quick flutter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram sat cramped in his chair, while the room darkened
as the evening crept on. All his love for his mother
moved in him with poignancy, now that she lay stricken
by this last blow of fate. After his boyhood, when his
mother had been all in all to him, she had become not much
more than a beautiful memory. Oxford, the War, Marriage,
had thrust her out of his active interests of life.
Weeks had passed, and he had not given a thought to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now he remembered, and renewed the devotion of his
boyhood to this little woman, so frail, but so brave, till
now, who had never spared herself to give her children
health, who had been so patient with all their woes, and so
eager for their happiness. He remembered when he had
been unwell, and she had tip-toed to his room at night, to
feel whether his forehead was “feverish,” to dose him with
little white pills from her homeopathic chest, and send him
to sleep with a few soothing words. They had taken all
that for granted, as children. Now, in manhood, Bertram,
sitting by his mother’s bed, reproached himself at the
thought of his ingratitude, accused himself of selfishness,
was sharply touched with, pity, because of all this little
mother of his had suffered in life, and with anger against
life itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The War had been an agony to her. She could never
understand the reason for all that massacre. It made her
doubt even the goodness of God, which before she had never
doubted. That so many boys should be killed, for “politics,”
as she said, sounded to her a terrible cruelty, due to
some madness which had overtaken the world. She had
submitted, doubtfully and silently, to her husband’s fierce
patriotism, and to Bertram’s excitement when he first enlisted,
and to all the war-fever of England. Perhaps
Dorothy’s marriage to a German, before the War, made her
less inclined to desire the wholesale slaughter of the enemy
than many mothers of England. She felt pity even for
the German mothers, to the great annoyance of Michael
Pollard, and the amusement of Bertram in the first ardour
of his hatred for the enemy—quickly quenched after a few
weeks of fighting, when he, too, lost all actual hate for the
poor wretches on the other side of the barbed wire, sitting
in mud, as he was sitting, with the same chance of being
blown to bits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had rejoiced in the Armistice because it had saved
Bertram, and Digby, who was getting ready to go out, and
all other boys of a fighting world. An enormous burden
of anxiety was lifted from her shoulders by the “Cease
Fire” of the guns. She became young in spirit again, for
a time, until gradually she came to suspect that there was
no great security in this peace, and was aware of an orgy
of blood and murder in Ireland, which came very close to
her when Digby became a “Black and Tan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram alone there, in her bedroom, in the darkness
that closed about him, thought of all the tragedy of life that
hadn’t ended with the war. It was still claiming its victims,
though Peace had come. It had released human passions
everywhere, unchained the primitive instincts of the
human beast, weakened the nerve-power and controls of
civilised life, made a wreck of many lives and hearts. Death
was still busy. Famine and pestilence were ravaging many
peoples. In the one letter he had received from Christy
in Russia there were terrible words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Millions are eating nothing but grass and leaves, and
not enough of that,” he wrote. “Typhus is sweeping these
people like a scourge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>England had escaped calamities like that, but unemployment
was creeping up like a dark wave—millions were idle
because of the Strike—and trade was at a standstill. What
was the future? “Europe is dying!” said Anatole France,
according to the papers, and Christy thought so too, in his
blacker moods. Did it matter much? What was life, anyhow,
to the individual soul? Not much of a game, except
for a little laughter, some moments of love, some years of
illusion! Here he was, sitting by the bedside of this mother
whose children had gone from her—all but himself—and
whose heart was broken by the death of her last-born in a
foul kind of civil war. Susan’s husband had been hanged.
Bertram’s wife had left him. A cheerful kind of family
record! Not worse than in millions of other families in
civilised Europe. Not so bad as in Russia, or Austria, or
Poland, according to reports.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His mother wakened, and spoke to him in a feeble voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you there, my dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was no longer wandering back to the early years, but
remembered what had happened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s terrible about Digby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was silent for a little while, and then spoke again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bertram! Work for Peace. The world is so very cruel,
and the future so dark! Work for peace, my dear. Peace
is so beautiful. Promise me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Promise you what, mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew his head down with her weak hands, and as
he kissed her, he heard her whisper the word “Peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was the last word he heard his mother speak. The
nurse came, and the doctor, and his father was sent for
from the House of Commons, where there was a debate
on the Coal Strike, as Bertram saw by the next day’s papers.
It was at some time past midnight that his father came
downstairs and entered his study, where Bertram was sitting,
waiting for the doctor’s latest word about his mother’s
health.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she better?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s dead,” said his father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lurched a little as he walked across the room, and then
sat heavily in his chair and put his arms down on his desk,
and his head on his arms, and wept with a passion of grief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the first time Bertram had seen him give way to
any emotion, except that of anger, and at the sight of that
grief all hostility to his father, because of so much hardness
and intolerance, was thrust aside by pity. He had
loved young Digby best of all his children, and the boy’s
death had struck him a frightful blow, which only his pride
and his freshly-inflamed hatred of Sinn Fein enabled him
to bear with self-control. But his wife’s death, so sudden
and so utterly unexpected, smote him beyond all endurance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been hard with her sometimes, he had made her
afraid of his temper, and many a time she had wept because
of his stern way with “the children,” but she’d never had
cause to doubt his love for her. He had loved her, in spite
of all tempers, perhaps because of it, with what he believed
to be never-failing devotion. To him she was the perfect
wife and perfect mother, and perhaps his intense egotism,
his old-fashioned belief in the “mastery” of the husband,
and the submission of the wife, were never shocked by the
knowledge that his wife sometimes described him to her
children as “very trying,” and—regarding Dorothy’s marriage—as
“most unjust.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had depended on her for his comfort, for his sense
of security in home life, for the thousand little duties which
she had done for him as a daily routine. Now that she
had been taken away from him like this, after Digby had
been killed—the boy he had loved best in the world—he
felt fearfully alone, and was broken-hearted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram put his hand on his father’s shoulder and said:
“Courage, father!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He remembered the better side of his father’s nature now,
the old days, before politics—the madness in Ireland—had
so embittered their relations. Michael Pollard had not been
always harsh. He had been playful when his children were
young; humorous and comradely at times. Perhaps his
children were partly to blame for the irascibility which had
overtaken him in later years. They had been self-willed,
deliberately rebellious of his authority, sarcastic when he
had laid down the law, regarding obedience and discipline,
stubbornly intolerant of his intolerance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Bertram thought now, in the presence of this stricken
man, forgetful for a while of his own tremendous loss, his
loneliness of soul, while he watched his father’s agony, and
tried to comfort him, and could not.</p>

<div><h1>XXXV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>It was after his mother’s funeral that Bertram’s courage
failed him. He had a letter from Joyce which put all
but the finishing touch to his sense of abandonment by any
kindliness of fate. She wrote to him from Paris—the Hotel
Meurice—where she had gone with Lady Ottery. She still
called him “My dear Bertram,” but her letter did not warm
his soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had been horrified to hear about Digby—that ought
to kill his sympathy with Irish rebels, if anything would.
She was also deeply sorry to hear about Mrs. Pollard’s
death, though not surprised, after so much worry and so
much tragedy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She wished to let him know that Holme Ottery was being
bought by an American, and that, to avoid the unhappiness
of seeing the old house pass into new hands, she and her
Mother had gone to Paris, on the way to Italy—while arrangements
were being made by Alban to warehouse some
of the old furniture and family treasures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her father had taken a new house in town, rather bigger
than the little old house in John Street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had sold the Lely portrait of Rupert Bellairs, and
she had wept to see it go. It was the symbol of the great
smash in the family fortune. England was doomed by a
prodigal Government, playing into the hands of Bolshevism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One passage in the letter stabbed him.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Kenneth Murless has shown me your articles in <span class='it'>The
New World</span>. That one—the first?—called “The Mind of the
Men” made me want to use bad language. No wonder you
refused that offer from General Bellasis! Your words
might have been spouted by a Hyde Park orator on an
orange box to a mob of shifty-eyed hooligans. How can
you, Bertram? How <span class='it'>can</span> you? To me it’s incredible, after
your war-service! It’s nothing but rank treason.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>There was something in the letter about the beauty of
Paris in May. Then another line or two about the hatred
of France for Germany, and for the English Liberals who
were playing into the hands of Germany.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The French won’t tolerate any breach of the Treaty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They will force Germany to pay, or march across the
Rhine and seize her industrial cities. I quite agree with
them. After all, we <span class='it'>did</span> win the war, though some people
behave as though it were a shame to do so.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Well, well, Joyce’s views on foreign politics didn’t matter
very much. Some other words in her letter mattered more
to him.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth Murless has come over to Paris in the Embassy—as
First Secretary. I see a good deal of him and he keeps
me amused. When are you going to be sensible and make
a career for yourself? I’m a little tired of being a grass
widow, though as a rest-cure it has done me good! I’m
ready to forget and forgive, if you care to join me here.
Besides, <span class='it'>it must be one thing or the other</span>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Those words were underlined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the end of her letter she signed herself “Yours affectionately,”
and Bertram laughed aloud at the words, but
not with any merriment of soul. She had wept when the
Lely had gone, not much when he had gone! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Kenneth
Murless amused her. She saw a lot of him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She was
ready to forget and forgive!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wrote a raging letter to her, and then tore it up. He
accused her of damned heartlessness, told her that he would
never play her lap-dog again, reminded her of the things
she had said to him at Holme Ottery, and ended by
saying that if Kenneth Murless amused her so much, she
had better make it one thing or the other, as far as he was
concerned. He would be glad to know her decision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having written all that, he heard, almost with physical
audibility, the words his mother had spoken to him on her
death-bed. “Work for Peace, Bertram!” She meant peace
in Europe, between peoples, with Ireland, but the spirit of
peace must begin in the heart of the individual, between
one and another—even between husband and wife. He
wrote another letter, less violent.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;'><span class='sc'>Dear Joyce</span>:</p>

<p class='pindent'>I’m still trying to earn a living. I’m sorry you don’t
like my articles, because they’re the way to that possibility.
You say you’re ready to forget and forgive. That seems
to me hardly good enough. When you tell me you love me
again and want my love, I’ll come to you. I thought that
was understood between us.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>He referred to her sympathy with his family afflictions:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yes, it’s sad about Digby, and mother’s death
leaves me very much alone.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That correspondence with Joyce didn’t seem to alter much
in their relations to each other. It left him in exactly the
same situation spiritually, and physically—a husband “on
probation,” with a verdict of disloyalty against him, but an
offer of pardon on recantation of faith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No, not good enough! Hopelessly impossible on any
basis of self-respect or decent comradeship, to say nothing
of love. Yet tempting to a man who hated loneliness, and
was alone; who, at the very sight of Joyce’s handwriting,
felt the same thrill of passion for her which had come to
him always at the touch of her finger-tips, or the quick
toss of her head, or the whiteness of her neck. It was a
temptation to his weakness, but he was stubborn as well
as weak, and wouldn’t yield to such a miserable compact
as this surrender would mean to his manhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was in a wretched state of mind, which Joyce’s last
letter intensified in wretchedness. Susan’s agony, Digby’s
murder, his mother’s death, his father’s grief and rage—for
he was raging now with more personal passion against
the Irish rebels—had smitten him at a time when Joyce’s
desertion would have been enough to cast him into the
blackest depths. It seemed as though God, or fate, had
a special grudge against him, and kicked him when he was
down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last blow—a feeble tap, perhaps, yet overpowering
for a while to his moral strength—befell him in a letter
from a man named Heatherdew, into whose hands, as literary
agent, Christy had placed the war-book.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;'><span class='sc'>My Dear Major Pollard</span> [he wrote]:</p>

<p class='pindent'>For our friend Christy’s sake, as well as in the usual
way of business, I have spared no trouble in trying to find
a publisher for your book, “The Machine Gun Company,”
which I may say I have read with the greatest interest and
admiration. It has now been to eight publishers and all of
them, without exception, express the opinion that, at the
present time, there is no market for war books. The public,
they say (I think incorrectly) wish to forget the war. My
own opinion is that they are tired of war books which do
not go to the heart of the business which you and I know.
However, I consider it useless to make further effort, and
I therefore return the manuscript, advising you to hold it
for a year or two, when it may have a better chance.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It was a vital disappointment. Bertram had always clung
to the hope of this book as a compensation for his failure
to get “a job,” as a justification, even, of his life. He had
put everything that was in him into this book, his secret
agonies and fears, his quality of courage, his love of England,
his understanding of the men, the ardour that was
his in the beginning of war, the joy in comradeship, the
later disillusion, the final disgust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the war as it had passed through his own soul,
and through the souls of all the men he knew. It was the
Absolute Truth, as he had seen it and known it. It was,
above all, his defence against Joyce’s accusations, and the
general suspicion of her family and friends that he was a
“slacker,” unpatriotic, and careless of his country’s honour.
Janet Welford had spoken well of it. “It’s good!” she had
said, and had praised it as “almost great.” Well, here it
was back again, soiled by publishers’ readers, scrumpled
through the post, condemned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram flung it into a drawer of the little old desk
where, as a boy in his father’s house, he had written secret
verses, youthful essays about London life, and, later, love-letters
to Joyce Bellairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An immense gloom closed down upon his spirit. What
was the use of anything? He had tried hard, and failed
utterly, in every way. He had made a frightful mucker of
life. His luck was out. Why kick against it? Why not
face up to the futility of life—for him, anyhow? He hadn’t
even had the decent luck of going out with the men who
had met a bullet or a bit of shell. Those things had passed
him by, though he hadn’t dodged them. That was a decent
way of death, and honourable, the easiest way out of all
difficulties. Even now, a bullet would solve a lot of problems,
and answer that alternative which Joyce had put:
“It must be one thing or the other.” He wondered if she
would weep as much for him as for the Lely portrait of
Rupert Bellairs. She might like the sentiment of being a
widow for a little while. She would look beautiful in her
weeds, with a little bit of white lace under the black round
her gold-spun hair, almost as beautiful as Lady Martock.
Kenneth Murless would say all kinds of consoling things in
his gentlemanly way. All her friends would write, wire,
send messages, flowers. The two Russian girls would utter
extravagances in broken English, and the Countess Lydia
would enquire whether Joyce’s husband had died a Bolshevik,
or suggest that he had killed himself at the bidding
of Lenin and Trotsky, “who have agents everywhere, <span class='it'>ma
chérie</span>!” Well, he would provide a lot of pleasure to all
kinds of people, and end his own misery at the same time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had left his old service revolver in the study at Holland
Street. Quite easy to get, if Edith were still there, as
parlour-maid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chatty Edith! She would be glad to see him again. He
would have to invent all kinds of lies to explain his absence
and his visit, unless he told her straight out that Joyce
had deserted him and he’d come to find his revolver to
blow his brains out. He could hardly do that! She would
scream, or send for the police, or swoon away. Then he
would have to fetch the doctor, or throw water at her, or
some nuisance of that kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anyhow, he could get his revolver. He had killed a German
with it once. That was in a raid near Bullecourt. He
remembered the jump into the German trench, after the
long crawl across No-Man’s Land and the long wait every
time a Verrey light went up and he had to lie doggo trying
to look like a sand-bag. The German sentry tried to stick
him with his bayonet, and he shoved the revolver into the
fellow’s face and fired it. It was the only thing to do, but
he was sorry afterwards. He had searched the man’s
pockets for letters and post cards—the Intelligence wanted
them for identifying a German division. They were all letters
from a girl named Lisa. She was dying to see Karl
again. She pined for his dear kisses. She was a lonely
little Lisa in Magdeburg. If only the cruel war would end!
So, in a dozen letters, and a score of closely scribbled postcards.
He was sorry he’d killed the fellow stone dead, with
that revolver in Holland Street. Now Karl would be revenged
by the same weapon that had killed him. Ironical
that! A sort of Greek fate business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram took the ’bus from the top of Sloane Street to
High Street, Kensington, and walked up the narrow passage
to Holland Street by the west side of St. Mary Abbot’s.
That was where he had married Joyce. “Isn’t she beautiful?”
said the women outside, and he agreed and thought
her the most beautiful thing on earth, and marvelled at his
luck. A little more than a year ago!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Newspaper placards were filled with Strike news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drastic Train Cuts.” “Sensational Scene in House of
Commons.” “Nat Verney States the Miners’ Case.” “No
General Strike.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>How trivial was all that nonsense. What would it matter
in a thousand years, or eternity, or to-morrow as far as he
was concerned?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little house in Holland Street had its blinds pulled
down. No answer came when he rang the bell. No answer
when he had pressed the knob six times. The chatty Edith
had gone away, and the house was abandoned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within a yard and a half of where he stood, at the corner
of the little front room which had been his study, in the
desk by the window where he had written the book which
no one would publish, was that revolver he wanted. Damn
silly to think it was so close and he couldn’t get it! He
could hardly commit a burglary in Joyce’s house, in broad
daylight! His luck was out again. God, or Fate, refused
him even this little bit of luck!</p>

<p class='pindent'>A young policeman sauntered up Holland Street, stood
on the opposite side of the road, and then crossed over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you want anything?” he asked, suspiciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Bertram. “I suppose the people have gone
away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Looks like it, with the blinds down,” said the policeman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram sauntered slowly away from his wife’s house.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Not even that bit of luck!</p>

<div><h1>XXXVI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>He walked through Kensington Gardens, where the
trees were in their first glory of green, through Hyde
Park, where the flower-beds were filled with tulips, down
Piccadilly, with its tide of gleaming cars, until in the
centre of Trafalgar Square he met Janet Welford. The
chances of meeting her were about seven million to one,
but he knew that he was going to do so. Or perhaps, when
he met her, it seemed by some trick of his subconscious
mind, the realising of expectation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo!” she said, dodging a motor-omnibus and jumping
onto a “save-my-life.” “What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What makes you think there’s anything the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She tucked her hand through his arm and told him his
face looked like a haunted man’s. She commanded him
to take her to tea somewhere. She had a craving for a
chocolate éclair, or even two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was at table in a tea-shop imitating a Tudor house
that Bertram told her of all the tragedy that had befallen
him since his visit to Ireland, ending in the rejection of
his book, which seemed a small thing to put with the death
of his mother, but was a death also—of hope and courage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m down and out,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Watch me eat éclairs!” was her unsympathetic answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew that it wasn’t heartlessness, but only her way
of dealing with trouble. A touch on his hand, an “I’m
sorry!” a silence, with understanding eyes, had been her
comment to his narrative about Digby and his mother, and
it was sympathy enough. But to his “down and out” she
put up a refusal, by way of mockery. It wasn’t in her
philosophy to accept any cry of “down and out,” not even
from a man blinded in both eyes, with his hands up to
his face, and pitch blackness in his soul. Not once but
many times she had heard such a cry from one of “her
men,” as she called them, and had refused to recognise
even his misery, and in a week or two, by some spell
she had, heard him laughing now and then. She put this
to Bertram now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not going to say Fortune hasn’t dealt you a bad
hand lately. You’ve been handed some of the worst cards
in the pack, I’ll admit, but there’s no need to sit down
and grizzle. Empires have fallen, crowns have toppled
to the dust, whole nations are starving, little old England
is at the crisis of her fate, and I’m in debt to my dressmaker,
so where do <span class='it'>you</span> come in? Don’t think you’re the
only pebble on the beach. Don’t imagine that fate is persecuting
you with a special grudge” (he had thought that!)—“when
there are millions of hearts bleeding with greater
agony than yours, and millions are carrying on mighty
plucky, in spite of odds against them. Look at that girl
with the fluffy hair and the red eyelids. She’s playing rag-time
in a tea-shop for all she’s worth, though she’s having
hell from a mother-in-law, and keeping a shell-shocked husband
and two children.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How d’you know?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” said Janet, calmly. “I’m only making
a supposition. If it isn’t that, it’s something else. You
can see she’s been crying all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes roved round the room, with its panelled walls
and sham oak beams, and “antique” furniture, made at
Maples. There were several “couples,” and two parties of
four. Ruthlessly Janet diagnosed their secret troubles.
The thin-faced man, sitting opposite a sad-looking woman,
with untidy hair, was suffering from a fear-complex. He
was “something in the City,” and afraid of losing the job
which kept a little home at Streatham, the wife with untidy
hair, and five children. He was in debt to his butcher.
He had a hard struggle to pay the last instalment on his
furniture, bought on the hire system. He was dodging
his income tax, and the chief clerk had told him that the
firm was on the rocks, owing to the slump in foreign
trade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How on earth do you know all those things?” asked
Bertram again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve studied life,” she answered. “There’s nothing I
don’t know about it. See that elderly man with the flabby
face, weak mouth, and puffed eyes? Next to the painted
flapper?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram turned slightly in his chair, and said “Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a frightful case. He’s the manager of a picture
palace. That little girl plays the piano for eight hours a
day for two pounds a week, at Croydon, except one day
a week—to-day—She keeps a drunken father on that,
and pays the rent of eighteen shillings, and ten shillings
a week for her little sister’s schooling. The manager is
a wicked old devil, and hates his poor drudge of a wife.
Of course it wouldn’t do to refuse his invitations to tea,
and other things. It’s not easy to get a job in another
picture palace, even if one does play the piano blindfold—right
notes or wrong—and use the rouge-pot ruthlessly.
Plucky kid, I think! Look how she pretends to be merry
and bright, poor child!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ever seen her before?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never. But it’s something like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She said Bertram had no idea of the amount of human
courage in a city like London. The heroism of fighting
men in war was nothing to the grim, enduring heroism of
husbands nagged by their wives, wives bullied by their
husbands, men struggling to keep on this side of destitution,
women fighting with all the strength of their souls
to keep “respectable” in underpaid jobs, young girls starving
themselves on milk and buns in order to dress well
enough for a chance in the marriage market, and all looking
on the best side of things, refusing to surrender, holding
on gamely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doesn’t it prove that the game’s not worth the candle?”
asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The game of life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She caught hold of his hand, and said, “That’s blasphemy!
That’s cowardice! Play the game, whether you
lose or win. Stick it out to the end. And forget yourself
by helping the other fellow. It’s only selfishness that
despairs. It’s damned egotism that makes a man sit down
and whine. There’s so much to do, so many to help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram drew a deep breath. He’d been sitting down
and whining. He’d wanted to quit before he’d played out
the game. He’d been within a yard and a half of the
coward’s white flag—the worst surrender.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet went on talking, wise things, foolish things, fantastic
things, and ate not two éclairs, but four (just to
make him marvel) and made him laugh heartily at her
description of the last meeting of the “Left Wing,” which
had broken up in wrath and violence because of a vote
against the General Strike. One of the girls had slapped
the face of one of the young men, and called him “a crawling
Pacifist.” He had responded by calling her a “Blood-stained
Bolshevik.” It had all been great fun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the sound of his laughter, Janet smiled with a whimsical
look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see life’s not so black, if one keeps a sense of
humour!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She proposed an evening at the theatre, after a little
dinner in Soho. It was a good dinner, and a merry piece.
Bertram laughed most because of Janet’s laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Afterwards, when they stood together on the kerbstone
hailing a taxi in St. Martin’s Lane, Janet put a hand on
his arm, and said, “Where are you going now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To my lonely little room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she said. “That’s not good for you. Is your
father home?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s gone over to Belfast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, come home with me, and help to make some
hot cocoa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that a good idea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was startled by the invitation at that hour of the
night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doesn’t it seem good to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wonderfully good! But what about—scandal and all
that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed gaily, so that the commissionaire outside
the theatre turned to smile at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Scandal? I’m immune against it. It never worries
me,—especially when I’ve souls to save.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you saving mine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was afraid he might lose it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the scruff of its neck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They drove to Battersea Park, and she gave him her
hand up the long flight of stone steps to her fourth floor
flat, where she stopped and panted a little before fumbling
in her hand-bag for her latch key.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flat was in darkness, but she switched on the lights
and the electric fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ever made cocoa?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you’ve got to learn to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He learnt, and found it easy, and good when made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She lit a cigarette, and dropped into a low chair and
told him to take the cane chair opposite, and put on his
pipe, if he liked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed a thousand years since he’d gone looking
for a revolver in Holland Street. Yet his tragedy hadn’t
been turned into comedy. His problems were the same.
His future was hopeless. His book had been refused.
Joyce was in Paris with Kenneth Murless. Young Digby
had been killed. His mother was dead. Strange that he
felt happier, almost cheerful, certainly glad of life again.
Loneliness was the worst thing in the world—to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He no longer felt lonely. Janet’s comradeship was wonderfully
good. It was splendid of her to open the doors
of this little sanctuary and let in a shivering soul to its
light and warmth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spoke of his book for the first time, and denounced
the publishers as silly sheep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep it a year,” she said, “and they’ll all be clamouring
for it. ‘We want the Truth about the War!’ they’ll
cry. ‘We can’t get enough of it! We hunger for it!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meanwhile what am I to do?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave it to Janet Rockingham Welford,” she said.
“That girl has planted men in the strangest places, inspired
them to noble and saintly deeds, led them to heights of
fame and fortune. Don’t worry, for you’ve come to the
right lady, the fairy godmother of the down-and-outs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe you can do anything you want,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All but a few things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are those?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head and smiled, and kept her secret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they talked until two o’clock. Then Janet put her
head on one side, listening to the distant boom of Big Ben
across the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mercy me! Two o’clock of a May morning and I
promised to be at St. Dunstan’s at ten!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pointed to the sofa, and said, “If you’re sleepy, sleep.
I go in there, to my virtuous couch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram rose, and took hold of her hands and spoke
with emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve saved me to-night. You’ve given me courage
again. You’ve been the best of comrades.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drew her hands towards him, and would have kissed
her, but she said “Not to-night! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. After midnight I take
no risks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She released herself from his hands, slipped away,
turned at the door with a ripple of laughter, and went into
her room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good night, Sir Faithful!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spoke those words as she shut the door, and locked it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram lay down on the sofa, and in a little while slept,
and dreamed not of Janet, but of Joyce. He dreamed that
he was searching for her in a wood, and could always
see her ahead of him in distant glades, but could never
get close to her.</p>

<div><h1>XXXVII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>A note came from Bernard Hall of <span class='it'>The New World</span>,
asking Bertram to go and see him at his office. He
greeted Bertram with that coldness which was but an
outer crust concealing the flame in his heart, flame of
passion against the injustice of life, its tyrannies and cruelties,
its immense unconquerable stupidities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take a seat, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram took a seat in a room strewn with papers and
books in careless disorder. A middle-aged woman with
grey hair smoothed back in the Quaker style, came in and
out with proofs, typewritten letters, cards from visitors,
which the editor of <span class='it'>The New World</span> put down in the general
litter on his desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall be engaged for half an hour, Miss Doe. They
can either wait, or call again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram wondered if he were to have the privilege of
that half hour, and what the reason might be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bernard Hall stared at his paper knife for a moment,
and then looked at Bertram moodily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Janet Welford tells me you’re at a loose end, more or
less.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it was Janet who had arranged this interview! Bertram
felt embarrassed because of that and his face flushed
a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Considerably more than less,” he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bernard Hall smiled, icily, and then his face resumed
its habitual mask of melancholy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Welford and Christy have both spoken highly of
that war book of yours. I’m not surprised you can’t get
it published. People want to forget that time of madness.
They’re getting a little ashamed of their own insanity.
My job—and yours, I take it—is to force them to remember,
so that it shan’t happen again very soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite so!” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram Hall stared at his paper-knife again, as though
its long blade symbolised some mystical thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s going to happen again,” he said presently, “unless
we can get some sense into the heads of the average man
and woman. The politicians are just preparing the way
for a new war, worse than the last—in twenty or thirty
years from now. I’m inclined to think they’ll succeed. The
only chance against it is the intensive education of peoples
towards the international idea. We must try and link
up with all active brains in Europe who are working for
peace and commonsense. There are quite a number of
them, but with scattered forces, powerless at the moment
against the tremendous strength of reaction and militarism.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram wondered again what all this had to do with
him. He was interested, but perplexed that Hall should
spend half an hour on a busy afternoon to talk broodily
about the state of Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The trouble is,” said Bernard Hall, “that what used to
be called the fountain of Truth is walled round by the
Enemy and kept under strict control. Its waters are carefully
and systematically poisoned before they are allowed
to flow into the open fields.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t quite follow,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean the distribution of news in the European Press.
There’s a conspiracy against Truth. It’s almost impossible
for public opinion to form any kind of verdict based on
actual facts. Newspapers nowadays use facts merely as
the raw material of propaganda. They’re manufactured
to suit the policy of the proprietors, or the purpose of
Government. By suppression, or alteration, or over-emphasis,
or the trick of false perspective, by scare head-lines
and editorial comment, they’re made to convey exactly the
particular idea which the newspapers desire to suggest to
its readers. Who knows what is the actual state of things
in Germany, whether she is on the brink of bankruptcy,
or getting rich? What’s the mental state of the German
people, after their tremendous defeat, their blood-bath, the
downfall of their pride? Are they cherishing the hope
of revenge, worshipping the old gods, or working out
some way of salvation? France—what about France? Is
Poincaré France? Or Paris? What are the people thinking?
Do they really want to invade the Ruhr and force
another war for unborn babes—as sure as Fate.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Do
you know, Pollard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, why not find out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had come to the point of the interview. He had an
idea that Bertram might wander around a bit in Europe—the
old battlefields, Paris—not Paris of the boulevards, but
Paris in the back streets, the little shops, the student
quarter, the intellectual clubs—then Germany, among its
peasants, in the back blocks of Berlin, in middle-class households.
Then Russia, if he liked. He could link up with
Christy in Moscow, write different kind of stuff, not statistics
or high politics, but the human side of things, how
the people were living—and dying—what they ate, how they
dressed, what was in their minds. He could pick up a
bit of Russian, or find people who spoke something else.
He might get a glimpse or two of the real truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed that Bernard Hall had been impressed by
Bertram’s article on “The Mind of the Men,” and one or
two other things he had sent in. That was the kind of
thing he wanted. No profound analysis of the European
situation—it was in flux, changing from week to week—but
intimate sketches of life; things seen; things heard; the
common thought; wayside conversations; little flashes revealing
the heart of folk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does the idea appeal to you?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It appealed to Bertram enormously. Here was his way
of escape, from the depression of life without an object;
from the immediate problem of earning a “living wage,”
perhaps from other troubles which had borne down on him,
like Joyce’s abandonment. It would give her more time
to make up her mind about “one thing or the other.” It
would give him more time to think things out, without
desperate conclusions based on boredom, loneliness, futility,
and introspective brooding. Here was objective work.
He would be looking out upon the world, not inwards with
nagging irritation. It would lift his mind, broaden it,
re-vitalise it. It would help him to adopt Janet’s remedy
for gloom and despair—interest in the other fellow’s welfare
and sympathy beyond selfishness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bernard Hall spoke about “terms”—a share of expenses,
articles paid for at a fair rate, no particular number laid
down, but one a week if possible. It was good enough,
enormously more, as a chance, than he could have hoped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When can you get off?” asked Hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bernard Hall smiled for the second time during the
interview.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not such a hurry as all that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it was fixed and Bertram shook hands on the understanding.
As he was leaving, Nat Verney, the Miners’
leader in the House of Commons, came in and gave him
a friendly nod.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good article of yours, Pollard, ‘The Mind of the Men,’
I agreed with every word of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’s the Lock-out?” asked Bernard Hall, and Bertram
noticed that he avoided the word ‘Strike.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nat Verney laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You read of my evidence before that private meeting
in the House of Commons? Most of the members were
bowled over by the facts I gave ’em, and admitted the
strength of the men’s case, for at least a compromise.
That’s how it’s going to end. A good old British compromise!
The wicked thing is that it ought to have begun
with that. But the owners didn’t give us a chance. Just
flung an ultimatum at our heads with a ‘Take it or leave
it!’ Well, we damn well left it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about the Triple Alliance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Verney shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve ratted. Timid as rabbits. There won’t be
any General Strike, or Social Revolution. The Government
has won that trick. But they look pretty silly with
their Army Reserve and Home Defence. Not a single case
of violence, except among soldiers who looted a village
through sheer boredom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shadow seemed to pass from Bernard Hall’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m relieved to hear all that, Verney. I’m for evolution,
not revolution. If you’d challenged the Government
by ‘direct action,’ there would have been bloodshed and
chaos, ending in the utter defeat of Labour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you’re right,” said Verney. “I’m not one of
the Reds, anyhow. I’ve no patience with those who want
to destroy at all costs, without a notion of how they’re
going to build up out of ruin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram left the two men talking. He had heard enough
to know that the Strike, or Lock-out, or whatever one
liked to call it, was going to end in compromise. After
all, he’d been right in backing the men! None of those
awful things had happened which had been prophesied
on the one hand by the Duke of Bramshaw, Lady Ottery,
and their set, on the other by the parlour Jacobins of the
“Left Wing.” The miners had gone on whitewashing their
cottages, sowing seeds in little front gardens. The Unemployed
in London, growing in numbers, because of industry
closing down, had not invaded Mayfair, except with
collection boxes and banners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Government and the Mine-owners had admitted at
least half the men’s case after an ultimatum far too brutal
in its original terms. England was not going to break
out in civil conflict just yet, or ever, if the men were given
anything like a fair deal. English character remained the
same as he had seen it in the trenches, solid, steady, without
passion. It had always chosen the middle of the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, he would soon be out of England, wandering among
other peoples, studying their problems and psychology.
Perhaps he would get as far as Russia, and link up with
Christy in Moscow! Extraordinary adventure! What was
it old Christy had said, at the top of his stairs?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’re not cut out for disloyalty—and it needs a
special temperament—cut and run when loyalty’s over-strained.
It’s the safest way .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and Moscow’s an interesting
place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Queer words! He hadn’t understood them at the time.
Now he seemed to see a special meaning in them. They
referred a little to Joyce, and a little to Janet. His loyalty
to Janet was getting overstrained. He was being tempted
to disloyalty, perhaps to Christy as well as to Joyce. Janet
had put a spell on him. That night in her flat was not
very safe for a lonely man, abandoned, temporarily or
otherwise, by his wife. It was too cosy there, making
cocoa over an electric fire for a girl whose laughter and
wisdom and comradeship were given generously. The
chance of other nights like that, and of comradeship closer
and more enduring, might overstrain loyalty to breaking-point.
He was human, and pretty weak at that. “Cut and
run,” old Christy had said. For him there would be torture
of conscience in disloyalty. “Sir Faithful,” Janet called
him. At least he wasn’t cut out for the part of Lancelot.</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“His honour rooted in dishonour stood,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;And faith unfaithful kept him falsely true.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>He remembered words he’d spoken once to Christy. “I
believe in loyalty.” He had said them sincerely then, before
temptation had come, testing him under heavy strain.
But there was something in him still which forbade, under
pain of self-torture, easy ways of escape which many men
chose in such a case as his—new love for old, a kind
mistress for an unkind wife, excuse for divorce, the usual
routine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What forbade him? What did he mean by conscience?
Not religious scruples, for he had no certain faith. Not
rigid principles of high morality, for he was tolerant of
other men’s personal arrangements in this affair of sex.
But by heredity, environment, upbringing, his mind was
hedged round with restraints and secret laws. If he broke
them, he would break himself. He could only be disloyal
to such laws within himself by being an outlaw to his
own code. Joyce had gone away from him, but he must
be faithful in body and soul to his pledge of loyalty to
her, or suffer hideously in self-esteem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps that was egotism again, the need of self-pride,
the prick of self-conceit and not of conscience. All very
difficult! Who could get down to the hidden springs, even
in his own soul? One could only know the effect of their
working, by experience of mental states resulting from
thwarted instincts or acts opposed to instincts. One could
balance the profit and loss of obedience to the inner law
and disobedience. Obedience was generally more profitable,
however difficult to resist the lure of disobedience.
When the lure was too strong in its spell, Christy’s advice
was “Cut and run!” Not heroic, but safer.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>When he told Janet that he owed her the best chance
of his life, his voice broke a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When are you starting?” she asked, and when he told
her that he was crossing to France the very next day,
she exclaimed, like Bernard Hall, that there was no such
burning hurry. But he told her he was in a hurry to
“make good,” as the Americans say, and that if he stayed
a few more days in town he might have to seek escape
from loneliness again in her little sanctuary, which would
strain her patience, and his virtue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That seemed to amuse her mightily, and she mocked him
as a modern St. Anthony, and liked his flattery (she said)
of her poor beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sent her love to Christy, if Bertram had the chance
of meeting him in Moscow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I don’t hear from you at least once a month,” she
told him, “I’ll abandon my blinded men to rescue you
from Bolshevists!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ll never write till you come!” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They talked, mostly nonsense, until he rose to say good-bye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a chance,” said Bertram, “that I mayn’t see you
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good Lord!” she cried, in sham alarm. “Are you
going to make another war?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but there’s the usual risk from one street to another.
A falling chimney-pot, a typhus bug, or some other
way of accident. Anyhow, I want to tell you now that
I’m eternally grateful for all you’ve done for me, in lovingkindness.
Wherever I am in the world, or beyond it,
I’ll never forget my dear comrade.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She let him take her hands and put them to his lips,
when she answered him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir Faithful, I’m not good at serious speech, and
don’t much believe in it, except at odd times, as a concession
to human weakness. But I’ve liked your company,
sir, and I’m sorry we can’t be closer partners—because
of fate and other things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps one day—” he said, and didn’t end his sentence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head, as though understanding his unfinished
words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll go back to Joyce. That’s best for you. She’s
the Beatrice of your <span class='it'>Divina Commedia</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He didn’t dispute that. It was the truth, as far as he
knew it in his own heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At least our friendship is eternal,” he said in a low
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Absence is the ditch of forgetfulness,” she said lightly,
and then quoted a French verse he had heard before, in
war-time, when a French girl had sung it in an old inn
at Cassel, on the way to Ypres.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before he went away, he asked her a question in which
she understood a subtle meaning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About Christy, what shall I say to him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet laughed, with a touch of extra colour in her
cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell him he needn’t have gone as far as Moscow. The
Superfluous Woman is a stay-at-home, and very happy
with her blind boys.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She came out onto the stone landing with him, outside
her flat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not midnight yet,” he said. “Will you risk it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Without a qualm of conscience,” she answered, and
gave him her lips to kiss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good luck, <span class='it'>mon ami</span>!” So she called into the well of
the great staircase, as he stumbled down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My heart’s thanks!” he answered back from a lower
flight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘<span class='it'>Partir, c’est mourir un peu!</span>’ ” she said in a laughing
way, yet a little sad too, he thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke the second line:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->

<p class='pindent'>Some people came out of the flat on the second floor
and tramped down the stone stairs noisily, and he had no
more chance of farewell with Janet Welford.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cut and run,” old Christy had said. Well, he was
doing so. As Joyce said, “It must be one thing or the
other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next morning he crossed from Folkestone to Boulogne.</p>

<div><h1>XXXVIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Folkestone-Boulogne!</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not three hundred years ago, but only three,
that those words, and that cross-Channel passage, meant
the way to roads which began very pleasantly past green
fields and French villages—with roofs on their cottages,
and towers to their churches—through long avenues of poplars
growing tall and straight, past cornfields or ploughed
fields, stretching away, hedgeless, to the horizon line, until
presently those roads became filled with deep holes, and
the fields were no longer green, but bare of vegetation
as though blasted by some curse of God, and the trees
were lopped and gashed, and the cottages had become unroofed,
and the churches had lost their towers, and then,
at the end of the roads, no house stood, no wall of any
size above a rubble of bricks and no man walked hand-high
above the ground, but all life was hidden in holes and
ditches, and death alone was visible, where unburied bodies
lay beyond a line of sand-bags and twisted wire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Bertram, all that seemed, for a few moments, as
he stood on the quayside at Boulogne, three hundred years
ago, and then not three years ago, not three minutes, but
still going on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was back from seven days’ leave. The purple-faced
Major with the megaphone could assuredly shout out “All
officers back from leave to report to the A.M.L.O.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eight hundred soldiers, or more, who had been as sick
as dogs, would stagger down the gangway, with tin hats,
rifles, gas-masks, packs, silent, grim, sullen, because they
were going back to the “bloody old trenches.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A line of cars would be drawn up for staff officers from
G.H.Q. With luck one might get a lift in one of them
part of the way and do some lorry-jumping for the rest
of the way, instead of waiting for the night train, so cold,
and slow, and crowded and dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A convoy of ambulances would soon arrive, with the
usual crowd of badly-wounded—the fellows with Blighty
wounds—and one would see their muddy boots, soles outward,
when the flaps were drawn back. Surely the war
was going on, for ever, and ever, and ever, as it had
seemed to those who enlisted in 1914 or afterwards.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No, all that was finished! It was merely a dream and
a memory. Bertram saw the last representative of the
British Army which had poured out here in tides—a dapper
young sergeant, in khaki, doing some job with the
customs officers or the French police. All else had vanished,
even the A.M.L.O. with his megaphone!</p>

<p class='pindent'>With this realisation, Bertram felt as though he were
the sole survivor of the war, the only man left alive from
that great massacre. None of those people around him
had had anything to do with it. In the smoking-carriage
where he took a corner seat, were two prosperous-looking
Jews with big cigars, two American business men, too old
to have been in the last push, an elderly Frenchman, who
bought <span class='it'>Le Matin</span> and the <span class='it'>Cri de Paris</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Along the corridor, and in other carriages were groups
of people going to Paris, or beyond Paris to other parts
of Europe, where the sun was shining and life “gay.”
They were “smart” people, still able to afford the pleasures
of life, in spite of the downfall of foreign markets, stagnant
trade, unemployment, high taxes. They had forgotten
the war and its agonies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one in his carriage bothered to look out of the
window as they neared Amiens, where one could still see
on a far hillside a line of earthworks, which had been
thrown up hurriedly as a last line of defence after the
Germans had broken through on March 21st and come
very close to the old city—as close as Villers Bretonneux
on the high ground outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram did not travel as far as Paris, though he was
tempted to go as far, because Joyce was there. It was
at Amiens that he left the train, as the beginning of his
wanderings through the old places of war, to find out what
the people there were thinking, how they were living,
according to Bernard Hall’s instructions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A crowd of ghosts walked with him up the rue des
Trois Cailloux—the Street of the Three Pebbles. They
were the Comrades of the Great War, who had crowded
that street when great battles were being fought, year after
year, in the fields of the Somme. He remembered them
mostly on rainy days. It seemed always to be raining
in Amiens, in war time. The officers wore trench-coats
plastered with mud and chalk. The men staggered under
their packs. The rain beat down on their tin hats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>French <span class='it'>poilus—Fusiliers Marins, Chasseurs</span>, infantry of
the line, Zouaves, sloped up and down, staring into the
shops, drinking <span class='it'>porto blanc</span> and fouler liquids in little
drinking dens strictly against the law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>English Tommies walked with little French girls down
the narrow side streets, went with them into dark old
houses up cut-throat alleys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Australian soldiers slouched around with hard, lean, leathery
faces, looking for trouble and often finding it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Crowds of Jocks with muddy knees, wet kilts, tin hats,
slanted over Harry Lauder faces, wandered about in a
grim mirthless way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Staff officers motored into the town from Army Headquarters,
or Corps, or Division.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cavalry officers rode in and put their horses in the back
yard of the Hotel du Rhin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Officers of every battalion of the British Army surged
along the narrow street—the Street of the Three Pebbles.
They were down from the line, while their Division was
in reserve, or were passing through on their way to the
line. Here, in Amiens, were shops, pretty women, restaurants,
cock-tail bars, civilian people, children, roofed houses,—the
last outpost of civilised life this side of the filthy
fields, and lice, and shell-fire, and sudden death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their ghosts walked with Bertram now. He stood at
the corner of the rue Amiral Courbet. It was there that
he had stood one night, talking to a French girl. It was
very dark, for there was no lamp allowed after daylight.
She flashed a pocket lamp in his face, and revealed her
own, white, with red lips, and black laughing eyes—a
pretty witch for a young man down from a battlefield
for one night of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Comment ça va, mon chou? La vie est triste, n’cst-ce
pas? Il n’y a qu’une consolation, un seul moyen d’oubli.
Un peu de rire, un peu d’amour! Qu’est-ce-que tu en
penses? Veux-tu?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sad life, she said, and only one consolation, one way
of forgetfulness. A little laughter, a little love. What did
he think about it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He’d thought a lot about it. He was twenty, then, in
1916. A boy, but doing a man’s job, and with no life
insurance for even another week, or another day, up there,
beyond Amiens, this side of Contalmaison still in German
hands. He agreed with this girl who had come up to
him out of the darkness. A little laughter, a little love.
Worth having before the next attack. Worth grabbing
at on a rainy night in war-time, and perhaps the very last
night on earth. Who could tell? Yet something had made
him refuse the offer, some fear, or law, or mental prohibition.
His mother had whispered a warning to him about
“bad women.” His two sisters, Dorothy and Susan, adored
him in those days, believed him spotless. He had been
brought up in a certain code, which had become part of
him, inescapable without stricken conscience, despite the
smashing of mental and moral foundations by the earthquake
of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Rien à faire!</span>” he had told the girl, not roughly, poor
kid, but decidedly. Nothing doing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mais oui, petit officier!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had grabbed his belt, pulled him towards her, kissed
his face, wet in the rain, with her wet lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was here, at this very corner, in July of 1916!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram walked down the next turning to the right,
leading to the Cathedral. On the other side was a gap
in a row of houses newly roofed. It was boarded round.
There, in that gap, had been “Charley’s Bar,” the great
cock-tail resort of thousands of young officers who drank
quickly because there might not be much time between
them and death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of them were still alive, but not many of those
who fought in the Somme battles. Izzard was one of them
still alive, that fellow in the funny shop at Ottery. He
had drunk like a fish in this place before it was knocked
to bits by an air bomb in that March of ’18. Bertram
had drunk with him, eggnogs, and champagne cock-tails.
They had both been thoroughly “blind” on more than one
afternoon, and slept themselves sober in the Hotel du
Rhin before dining at the Godebert in the rue des Jacobins,
where Izzard and he had flirted outrageously with
the pretty Marguérite, but without much success as she
was coveted by Staff officers, and Brigadiers, and even a
Major-General.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was to the Hotel du Rhin that Bertram now went,
still walking with ghosts and ancient memories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last time he had been there its stairs and passages
were strewn with broken glass, and with several other
officers he had sat in a cellar listening to houses falling
with tremendous crashes, while a fleet of Gothas overhead
played merry hell all through a night which was the blackest
in the war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His machine-gun company had been cut to bits outside
Villers Bretonneux. Christy had been wounded in the
lung and taken away by the stretcher-bearers. The Germans
had made a clean break through and there was very
little up the road to bar their way to Amiens. Bertram
had been ordered to join up with another crowd for a last
stand somewhere near Boves. The crowd had gone missing,
it was impossible to search for them at night, and
the air-raid over Amiens was the worst thing he’d seen
in that way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had begun at seven-thirty in the evening, with two
explosions outside the windows, smashing them, and filling
the dancing-room with splinters. The lady manager was
there, doing accounts with a young staff officer. She had
yellow hair, and two bright spots of colour on her cheeks,
and wonderful courage. Her face was pale beneath the
bright spots of colour, but that was her only sign of fear.
Joseph, the waiter with the shrill voice and high-pitched
laugh, disappeared in the direction of the cellar. The
other waiter—what was his name?—an old fellow, with
side-whiskers, wandered about cursing the <span class='it'>sales Boches</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A frightful and fantastic night, with dead men and dead
horses in the street outside. Now like a dream! Since
then, Amiens had tidied up its streets, re-built many of its
houses—though not the great gap between the rue des
Trois Cailloux and the rue des Jacobins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An orchestra was playing in the Hotel du Rhin. American
tourists and French commercial travellers were feeding
in the room where Bertram had sat down on that night
of tragedy, with three mayors who had lost their towns,
and officers who had lost their Divisions, wondering how
long it would be before the head of a German column
marched into Amiens. An orchestra fiddling jazz tunes
to American tourists!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there, miracle of miracles, was the lady manager
with the yellow hair, and Joseph, the shrill-voiced waiter,
and the old boy with the side whiskers! Bertram went
up to the lady manager, and greeted her with emotion, as
one whom he had known in the wonderful years, and as
one who remembered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still here, Madame! You remember me, perhaps?
That night of the air-raid, and other nights!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook hands with him, and pretended to remember
his face, though thousands of young officers had passed
through this hotel in the years of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What memories, monsieur! Unforgettable to us, though
others have forgotten!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Amiens is almost restored,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s still much to be done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How strange it must be for you, now that there are
no British soldiers in France! This hotel used to be
stuffed with officers of ours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We get tourists to see the battlefields. English officers
come up like you, and say ‘Do you remember me, madame?’
Sometimes I’m tempted to say, ‘Do you remember the agony
of France in those years of war?’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why that, Madame? We cannot forget.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shrugged her shoulders and smiled bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your Lloyd George forgets. He makes friends with
the Germans. He wishes to let them off their punishment.
He will let them get strong again, so that one day they
will come back and crush us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He wants peace in Europe. He wants to prevent another
war. Anyhow, England doesn’t forget the heroism
of France nor her sufferings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>C’est bien!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bent to her table, and added up a column of figures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the yard an American tourist enquired how long it
would take to drive to Château Thierry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night Bertram met another woman whom he had
known in Amiens in the years of war. It was the chambermaid,
and she remembered him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly you were one of the young officers who used
to stay here in the war?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook hands with her, and said, “I’m the officer
whose socks you mended once. You told me about your
lover, Jean, who was killed at Verdun. We talked long
that night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, she remembered him, his very face, those socks
she had mended, that talk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Tiens! Quel plaisir!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was glad to find that he was still alive. A middle-aged
woman of plain features, she had not been much
of a temptation to young officers down from the line.
Yet some of them, deprived of womanhood, for months
on end, had made amorous advances even to her, which
she had repulsed with loud laughter, in a heavy-handed
way. She had mothered some of the younger men, in a
peasant way, and had given them good advice about the
girls who lured them in the streets, with their flash lamps,
like that one at the corner of the rue Amiral Courbet.
Her lover, Jean, a butcher, had been killed at Verdun, and
she had wept a little in Bertram’s room, and then laughed,
and said she supposed men were made to be killed that
way, like sheep to be eaten. “<span class='it'>C’est la vie.</span>” It was life
and war, which would last as long as the Germans were
part of the human race.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now she leaned on her broom, talking to Bertram about
the changes since the war. Prices were high. It was hard
for poor people to live. The bourgeoisie were making
plenty of money, but the Government was ruined, she was
told. The Germans evaded their payments. Anyhow, no
German gold came to the people who were trying to build
up their cottages again in the battlefields. She had a cousin
at Lens. A mother of six. They had no water, no gas,
no stone for building, no money for reconstruction. Three
years after war they were still miserable. Victory had
not brought happiness to France, nor safety. The Boches
would come back again one day. It would begin all over
again. A pity they weren’t all killed when the French
and English had the chance! Now the English hated the
French, and loved the Germans, for some reason!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What makes you think that?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is true, is it not?” asked this woman, Jeanne, quite
simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was surprised, and incredulous, when he told her
that she was mistaken, and that the English loved France
still, and desired to help her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What gives you the idea that England hates France?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She said she read <span class='it'>Le Matin</span>, which told her so. It
was the same in the <span class='it'>Journal d’Amiens</span>. Everybody spoke
about it—especially <span class='it'>les garçons</span>, who were always talking
politics. She didn’t understand these things, but she picked
up her news from the others. It was public opinion. No
one could go against public opinion. <span class='it'>C’est formidable,
l’opinion publique!</span></p>

<div><h1>XXXIX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>For several weeks Bertram wandered about the old
places, mostly a-foot, or getting lifts in country carts,
once or twice taking a train which crawled from Arras
to Lens, and from Bapaume to Péronne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had wayside conversations with peasant men and
women, young farmers who had been <span class='it'>poilus</span>, commercial
travellers from Paris and Lille, mayors of towns wiped
off the map, but now on the sites of their old <span class='it'>mairies</span> in
wooden huts, superintending <span class='it'>la reconstruction</span> which, so
far, didn’t seem to amount to very much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He passed the night in wooden <span class='it'>estaminets</span> in fields where
once British youth had been swept with fire year after
year—Ypres, Hooge, St. Julien, Dickebusch, Souchez, Neuville
Vitesse, many other places haunted surely by boys
he had passed along the roads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trenches had silted in. He wandered about, and
poked about with his stick, trying to find some of his old
dug-outs, and though he had known every inch of this
ground, every hummock and hollow, could not find them,
for the most part, only one, indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found a dug-out in which he had lived, not far from
Bourlon Wood, by the ruins of Havrincourt Château. The
earth had silted there too, but he borrowed a spade from
a friendly young farmer near by, and unearthed the wooden
steps, and cleared out the entrance, and went inside. The
farmer gave him a bit of candle, and would have come inside
with him, unless Bertram had said, “Wait a few
minutes. I want to be in here alone!” The man understood
with the quick sympathy of the French for sentiment
like that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It <span class='it'>was</span> sentiment, but also more than that. This was a
ghost chamber of tragic memories, the unburying of the
dead past. The candle burned straight with a thin flame.
By its light Bertram found a wooden table, and two chairs,
made out of boxes. It was Bill Huggett, who had knocked
them together. On the table were things which had belonged
to Bertram—an empty tin of John Cotton tobacco
which Joyce had sent him, a cracked mug which he had
found in Havrincourt Wood, an old envelope addressed
to him.</p>

<div class='lgc' style=''> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>“Major Bertram Pollard, D.S.O., M.C.</p>
<p class='line'>Machine Gun Corps, B.E.F.”</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>It was in Joyce’s handwriting. Good God! Fancy finding
it here again, moist and muddy as the walls had oozed
about it and earth had dropped! How eagerly he must
have opened it when it came! Certainly he had kissed it
before opening it. Now Joyce was his wife, away in Paris
or somewhere, without him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat very still on one of the boxes, with his elbows
on the table, as often he had sat in this hole at the end
of ’17. Christy had come down the steps to report the
state of things outside. Old Fritz was putting up a bit
of a barrage. Bourlon Wood was soaked with gas. He
had told the men to keep their masks handy. A counter-attack
was expected within the next twelve hours. A man
had just had his leg blown off in Beer Alley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram’s soul lived again in that time. The smell of
the dug-out, that thin candle flame, these oozy walls, this
table, were no more real than that dead past, yet as real.
The past was present. The present was past. There was
no difference. All that he had seen in war, the death of
many good men, the agony of the wounded, the stench
of death, the comradeship of young officers, their laughter,
Christy’s tears when his nerve broke, his own fears of
fear, the heroism of common men, the endless slaughter,
the waste of youth and life, came back to his mind, as
drowning men are said to see all their life as in a mirror.
Was it all going to happen again? Bernard Hall thought
so, unless some divine change happened in human nature
by “intensive education”! Jeanne, the chambermaid,
thought so! Nearly all those French people with whom he
had talked along the wayside believed that after a few
years, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, <span class='it'>les Boches</span> would come
back again for vengeance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the candle flickered and shortened in a pool of wax
on the table, Bertram, sitting there with its feeble light surrounded
by darkness, heard a voice speak to his soul, very
clearly, as once before. They were the words his mother
had spoken on her death-bed. “Bertram, work for Peace.
Promise me—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He raised his head sharply. Had he heard those words
only in imagination, or had they been spoken to him?
He had heard them clearly, with distinct utterance, yet
it must have been only one of the memories brought back
in that dug-out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, he would work for peace, so that boys now young
needn’t live in holes like this until they were gassed to death
or blown to bits, or buried alive. He would work for
Peace, as far as he could understand the chaos of life, as
far as he could write words of warning, and conciliation,
and commonsense, and truth anyhow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The candle guttered out. He struck a match, picked up
the envelope in Joyce’s handwriting, and groped his way
up, and out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young farmer was waiting for him, and stared at
him a moment, with a queer smile in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A droll life in those days. With good moments, and
many sad, eh? Sacred Name! I laugh sometimes when
I think of the blood, the death, the lice, the mud, the <span class='it'>ordure</span>
of it all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you go through it again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To save France one would go through it again. Not
willingly. But what else? When the Germans attack
again, France will fight again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think they will attack again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Naturally. They will want revenge. When they have
renewed their strength, they will come back. It is human
nature, monsieur.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can France stand another war?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young peasant farmer stared across the field to
Bourlon Wood, so quiet now, so safe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not alone. But we have Poland, Serbia, Czecho-Slovakia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“England?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man looked uncertainly at Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur can tell me, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young Frenchman shrugged his shoulders again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“England does what pays her best. Industry, commerce,
count with her most. It’s the English character. Hard
bargaining, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram reminded him how many men Britain had sent
to France, in time of war, how many bodies of her youth
lay still in French soil. Was that hard bargaining? Or
self-sacrifice, for honour’s sake?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The <span class='it'>Boches</span> were England’s trade rivals. Their Fleet
was a menace to <span class='it'>Grande Bretagne</span>. Is it not so, Monsieur.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram sat with him on a hummock of earth, shared
some sandwiches with him, and tried, in simple phrases,
with an emotion that he felt, to assure this peasant who
had been a <span class='it'>poilu</span> of France, that England had a soul above
shop-keeping, that her share in the war had been not only
enormous in sacrifice, but heroic in ideal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man listened to him with patience, but also with
amusement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur is an idealist! After experience of war?”
That was strange. He himself was a realist. Nations, like
individuals, would fight for self-interest, to save their skins,
their land, their women. They would fight to get revenge,
to kill people they hated, because of pride, and more because
of injury, to capture their trade, or their territory. It was
natural. It had always been like that. It would never
change.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram saw in this young farmer the type of French
manhood, the very soul of France. Through centuries of
history, men like this, on this soil, had fought for their
land and their women, for conquests, for pride in France.
They had been invaded, harassed, and ravaged. They had
lived always between the plough and the sword, first one,
then the other, turn and turn about. Peace was only an
interlude, either when France was weak, in defence, or
when France was strong, in aggression, in contraction or
expansion, as an Empire or Republic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The French mother rocking her babe in the cradle knew
in her heart that one day this man-child would march
away to battle. It was in the songs she sang to send it to
sleep. The boy knew that when manhood came he would
leave home for the barracks, to learn soldiering as he
had learnt farming. So it had been in the time of the
Valois, in the reign of Henri IV., before Burgundy was
France, before the Revolution, all through the Napoleonic
era, ever afterwards, till 1918, with brief spells for recovery,
the binding of wounds, the growing of another generation
of boys. “<span class='it'>C’etait toujours comme ça. Ça ne
changera jamais.</span>” It was always like that. It would
never change.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram glanced sideways at the man; thirty-five, perhaps,
with a strong, hard profile, ruddy skin, fair moustache.
A Frank of northern stock. Teutonic rather than
Latin, though, perhaps, with a strain of Latin blood. The
typical <span class='it'>poilu</span> of Picardy, Normandy, Artois.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“France cannot afford another war,” Bertram said; “it
would bleed her to death. Must there always be conflict?
Why not make friends with the Germans?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young farmer laughed loudly, and spat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Friends with the <span class='it'>Boches</span>? Does one make friends with
a hungry tiger? If one can’t kill it at once, one digs a
ditch round one’s house and keeps one’s gun ready. So I
have heard! There’s still another way to treat a tiger.
Cut its claws and cage it. That is our way with Germany
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the tiger escapes and grows its claws?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is still the gun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the gun gets rusty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then the tiger gets its meal. He’s a fool who lets his
gun get rusty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it breaks, and he has not money to buy another?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is unfortunate! The tiger wins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a fatalist. Also he assumed that the German
by nature was a tiger. Was that true? Bertram thought
of all the German prisoners he’d seen in time of war, some
he had helped to capture—simple, straw-haired young peasants,
who hated war, and loved peace, and the arts and
crafts and labours of peace, not soldiers by instinct and
passion, like the French, but soldiers by coercion, by discipline,
by sentiment; brave, efficient, obedient, but without
fire. They were not “tigers,” as far as he had seen them,
but rather sheepish fellows. It was not utterly impossible
that they might abandon the hope of revenge against
France, if France would abandon her passion of hate, her
uttermost demands of punishment and payment, her pound
of flesh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was useless to argue with this peasant-farmer, though
he had a clear intelligence, and, like most Frenchmen of
his class, a surprising gift of words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“England is a good friend,” he said, at the end of this
conversation. “There must never be cause of quarrel between
England and France. The very dead would rise out
of these fields to protest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was here, by Havrincourt Château that English and
Scots had advanced on a day of November in 1917, with
Tanks leading the way towards Cambrai. Now it was quiet
in the fields, and birds were singing, and no smoke clouds
burst in Bourlon Wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young Frenchman shook hands with him and smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Au revoir, mon camarade! Comme vous-même, je
n’aime pas la guerre. Mais, que voulez-vous? Il vient
quand il vient!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had no love for war, but when it came, it came!
Terrible philosophy, upon which no peace could be built,
no forward step taken by educated humanity. To this peasant,
perhaps to all his kind, war was as inevitable as natural
calamities, like rains and droughts, earthquakes, and
thunderbolts. And the German was still the German—the
Blonde Beast. <span class='it'>Les sales Boches!</span></p>

<div><h1>XL</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The hostility—suspicion, even,—of the French people
regarding England was to Bertram terrible. They
were very friendly to him, all those people whom he visited
in their huts or walked with over old battlefields. Some
of them were even emotional, as one old woman in an
<span class='it'>estaminet</span> along the Arras-Doullens road with whom he
had been billeted for a time, and who flung her arms about
him and kissed him on both cheeks, and wept a little, and
laughed, and cooked a chicken for him. But when they
spoke about England, it was with doubt, or resentment, or
anger; now and then with passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He couldn’t get to the root of their grievances. They
talked vaguely of England crossing the path of France in
Syria. In what way? They didn’t know, but said: “<span class='it'>On
dit dans les journaux</span>—” It is said in the papers!</p>

<p class='pindent'>They believed, many of them, that the value of the franc
was deliberately made low by the artful jugglings of British
financiers. They were certain that “Loy-Zhorzhe” was pro-German
for corrupt and sinister motives, that British
diplomacy was jealous of French victory, and intrigued
everywhere to secure a new balance of power in Europe, so
that French supremacy should be weighted down by the
restoration of Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In any case, England desired to thwart France of the
fruits of victory, and was always manœuvring to let Germany
off her debts, to prevent France from seizing German
industrial cities if Germany defaulted in her payments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was idle for Bertram to argue that Lloyd George and
the British people were afraid that if Germany were pressed
too hard, beyond her power to pay, beyond human nature,
she would seek to escape by force, would nourish desires
for revenge which would lead ultimately and inevitably to
another war. Germany would form an alliance with Russia,
or break into such revolutionary chaos that the peace and
recovery of Europe would be retarded for more than another
generation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put these ideas to a French priest as they sat together
in a little wooden presbytery near the ruins of a church
on the west side of St. Quentin. They had met in a cemetery
where British and French soldiers lay buried side by
side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram, standing bare-headed there by the grave of
one of his own comrades, was greeted by the priest, a tall,
middle-aged man with a bronzed, clean-shaven face, and
the scar of some wound down his right cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are an English officer, perhaps?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, <span class='it'>mon père</span>, in the old days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, you helped to fight for France! It was a good comradeship
in those days. I was a soldier also, a captain of
artillery, with the ‘<span class='it'>Cent-Vingt</span>.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He invited Bertram to his simple <span class='it'>pot-au-feu</span>, with a cup
of coffee afterwards, and a <span class='it'>petit verre</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was over that cup of coffee that they argued about
French and British policy, and then that Bertram defended
the British point of view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do your English Liberals hate France so much?”
asked the priest. “I cannot understand. It is to me incredible!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram denied that English Liberals hated France. He
tried to explain, in faulty French, the “Liberal” idea in
England. It was a belief that another frightful war could
only be prevented by allowing Germany to recover, and
dealing with her so generously that she would not desire
vengeance. English Liberals believed that the whole
philosophy of Europe must be changed, and that people
should rise beyond the old “Balance of Power,” with
secret or open alliances dividing Europe into groups. The
peoples of all nations wanted peace. It was only the old
diplomacy that prevented the fulfilment of their desire, and
a general brotherhood of European democracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The priest struck his fist on the table so that the coffee
cups jumped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All that is illusion,” he said, and he almost shouted
the words. “It is hypocritical nonsense. Peace can only
be secured by keeping Germany crushed and weak. England
is treacherous to France by making secret overtures
to Germany. It is a betrayal of the dead. An outrage to
France.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram lit his pipe, and smoked in silence for a moment,
astonished and distressed by the violent passion in this
priest’s voice, by the flash of fire in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mon père</span>,” he said, “you speak like a soldier, and not
like a priest. Surely you of all men should believe in the
forgiveness of enemies—wasn’t it ninety times nine?—and
the blessings promised to the peacemakers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I spoke as a Frenchman as well as a priest,” was the
answer. “I have seen the flower of French youth swept
down by the <span class='it'>sales Boches</span>. I have seen the beauty of their
mother, France, blasted, as in those fields outside. I have
seen our women outraged by the brutality of the enemy. It
is because of these things, and because I believe in the
justice of God that I demand the full punishment of an
infamous people. I warn you, sir, that if Great Britain
endeavours to thwart that divine justice, France will regard
her also as an enemy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The dead listen to us, <span class='it'>mon père</span>,” said Bertram, simply.
“Outside this window their bodies lie together. It is too
soon for any Frenchman to speak of England as an enemy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is too soon for England to behave as such,” said the
priest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For several hours they talked, this Frenchman and Englishman,
these two soldiers of the Great War, this priest
and layman. At the end of that time, Bertram knew that
no words in any language or with any eloquence, could
ever reconcile their opposing views. The priest believed
in “the sword of France” as the means of peace in Europe.
Bertram believed in reconciliation, the progress of commonsense,
the education of democracy, the spirit of peace
in the hearts of common folk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Illusion!” said the priest again. “Illusion! In the heart
of man, and especially in the heart of Germany, is hatred,
evil, greed, brutality, fear, rivalry. So it has been. So it
will always be, despite the grace of God, and the teaching
of Jesus Christ. We have to guard against these natural
passions. We have to uphold justice by force. We must
never be weakened by a craven fear of war. Worse than
war is cowardice or dishonour. Worse than hatred is the
betrayal of friendship. May England be true to France!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May France remember England’s sacrifice!” said Bertram,
“and our dead that lie in her soil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The priest answered his farewell in a friendly way, gripping
his hand first, as a comrade, and then giving him a
priest’s blessing. But when Bertram trudged away from
the presbytery to a wooden <span class='it'>estaminet</span> a mile away, he was
enormously distressed in spirit. This priest, Jeanne, the
chambermaid, the young farmer near his old dug-out, a
commercial traveller from Paris, the Mayor of Arras, scores
of friendly people he met along the old roads of war and
on the old battlefields, had talked in the same strain, used
the same kind of argument, lamented the ill-will or the
“treachery” of England; or if not of England, then of
“Loy-Zhorzhe,” who seemed to them not so much a human
personality as an evil power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What hope was there for peace in Europe, if France
pursued her policy of force, to crush Germany and keep
her weak? What chance for the “Comrades of the Great
War,” lounging about Labour Exchanges in London,
marching in processions of unemployed, with banners saying,
“We Want Work”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>There would be no work until Great Britain could sell
her goods in the markets of Europe. Those markets could
never buy if Germany were thrust into such ruin as that
of Austria. Germany, perhaps allied with Russia, would
struggle like a wild beast. The “sword of France” would
not be strong enough to keep her weak for ever. Then
France would call to England again. Would the roads
have to be tramped again by battalions of boys from England,
Scotland, Ireland, going up to the fields of death?</p>

<p class='pindent'>This thought came to Bertram as he went up a road past
the ruined village of Barisis. The moon had risen in a
pale sky, still blue, and its light silvered the wooden crosses
in a military graveyard. Row by row they stood above the
neatly ordered graves. For scores of miles, for hundreds
of miles, across France, the moon illumined cemeteries like
this, crowded with French and British dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God, give us Peace!” said Bertram, aloud, as he bared
his head in salute to old comrades with whom he had
trudged these roads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An immense fear invaded his spirit, and a kind of shudder
shook him, for he seemed to hear again the march of
youth advancing to another Armageddon in these fields—the
last youth of Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was glad to get into the warmth of the wooden
<span class='it'>estaminet</span>. An enormously fat Frenchman greeted him
jovially.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur is hungry, beyond doubt! My wife has
cooked an excellent chicken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wife, a pretty, thin-faced woman, with merry black
eyes, addressed him as “<span class='it'>mon capitaine</span>” and spread a
napkin as a cloth on a deal table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had been in St. Pol during all the war. Did he know
St. Pol, not far from Hesdin—? Yes? Then surely he
must have known, among English officers who had been
friends of hers, <span class='it'>le capitaine</span> Jenkins, <span class='it'>le lieutenant</span> O’Mally,
<span class='it'>le commandant</span> Stuart? She had <span class='it'>un très bon souvenir</span> of
the English Army. Sometimes her husband was jealous
when she praised the English officers so much!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Without cause, I’m sure!” said Bertram, with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman laughed, and her black eyes danced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In time of war there are many temptations!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She teased her preposterously fat husband, and he looked
annoyed, and said, “<span class='it'>Tais-toi</span>, Yvonne!” She made a little
face at him, behind his back, and when Bertram went to
his bedroom after dinner, she lighted his way with a
candle, there being no gas in the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Merci, et bonne nuit, madame!</span>” said Bertram, politely,
taking the candle from her, and putting it down on a
wooden chair by the bedside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him with a queer, wistful smile, and spoke
in broken English.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not married in time of war. You understand?
English officers like me very much. Take my hand, try to
give me kiss—what you say?—flirt! My big, fat husband
not like me talk of those days. But I like remember! You
will give me English kiss for old remembrance, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She held her face up, after glancing at the half closed
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram gave her a kiss. Why not? It was good to
find some one who remembered the British Army with
pleasure and affection. She kissed him six times in return,
and then, with her finger to her lip, ran out of the room, as
a big voice shouted:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yvonne! <span class='it'>Qu’est-ce-que tu fais, toi?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night Bertram dreamed that it was Joyce who kissed
him.</p>

<div><h1>XLI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The thought of Paris pulled Bertram so strongly that
he could wander no longer in the old war zone, and
getting back to Amiens from Bapaume, took the train to
the Gare du Nord. He had written some articles for <span class='it'>The
New World</span>, photographic and phonographic, things seen
and heard, without comment or moral, and some of them
had been published, as he knew, not from seeing them—<span class='it'>The
New World</span> was not sold in Paschendaele or Hooge!—but
from a note written by Bernard Hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your stuff is admirable, and much quoted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was endless material in the “reconstruction” of
Picardy and Artois—the human “stuff” which Hall wanted.
Bertram had only to sit down to table in any little <span class='it'>estaminet</span>,
mostly built of wood, amidst a group of huts, in this country
of ghosts (as it was to him) to hear in the casual conversation
of peasants the aftermath of war’s enormous tragedy
to France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Young peasants, once soldiers of France, told tales of
hair-raising horror about the trenches of Verdun, or Vermelles,
or any part of the battle front, with a simplicity,
and matter-of-fact remembrance, beyond all eloquence or
art in tragic effect. Some of them had been prisoners in
German camps, and their long servitude, monotonous in
starvation and misery, had been worse than trench-life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Women who had been caught behind the German lines,
in Lille, Valenciennes, elsewhere, told of their years of
anguish, and inflamed again the passion of the men who
listened. Reference to death recurred in casual discourse
with continual iteration. “Before Jean was killed,” “since
my man’s death,” “when my boy fell in the assault on
Souchez,” a score of times in any half hour of gossip over
a flask of <span class='it'>vin ordinaire</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The loss of homes and fortunes, the difficulty and illusion
of this “reconstruction” which was used as a spellword
by the French Government, as though the word alone
would rebuild houses and churches and flourishing farmsteads,
the sadness of women bereft of fathers, husbands,
sons, brothers, lovers, by the immense slaughter of French
manhood, and the abiding hate of France for Germany,
were revealed to Bertram with intimate and distressful detail,
as he sat in the corner of any tavern, or talked with
any group of men and women in field or market-place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It came to his mind that here was material for a new
“Sentimental Journey” which might live in history because
of the tales of Armageddon, but he renounced the idea
for himself, beyond his brief sketches for Bernard Hall,
because of his desire to get to Paris. It was not the lure
of Paris in June, nor that joyous anticipation which had
belonged to “three days’ Paris leave” in the old days of
war, but the urgent, irresistible, almost sickening desire to
see Joyce again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During this time of loneliness, for he was alone with his
soul despite his wayside conversations, some fretfulness
of spirit passed from him. He seemed to see things with
more clarity. His thoughts struck deeper into the essential
meaning of life. Contact again with the devastation of war,
the sharp realities of the immense heritage of woe left by
those murderous years, his conversation with the ghosts of
youth, crowding about him in those little forests of wooden
crosses, in those quiet fields where the noise of death had
once been very loud, seemed to kill the nagging of his own
selfish instincts, to rebuke his egotism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How trivial was the failure or success of his own life!
What did it matter in the balance of history, in the destiny
of peoples? He had no right to life at all, except by a
fluke of luck, or the grace of God. So many of his friends
lay here in French soil, as young as he, and younger. That
he was alive, glad to hear the lark singing again above these
fields (even as they had sung above the noise of gunfire),
with the warmth of the sun in his face, was so much to the
good, after all, that he could pay back for that only by
service and the dedication of life to things beyond himself.
He might, by some small grain of truth, by the force of
mere desire, by written word or spoken word, help the
chance of peace, so that these fields need not be strewn again
with dead boys. To that attempt he was dedicated. It
was the meaning of his future life, if it had any purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the mental storms of the last few months, the
quarrel with Joyce, his mother’s death, the tragedy of
Susan, and of Digby, he seemed to have aged by twenty
years in understanding and experience. A little by Janet
Welford’s help, and perhaps more than he could estimate, he
had risen above the weakness of self-pity, the most miserable
disease, incurable, if allowed to go too far.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had been all foolishness and pettiness,—that quarrel
with Joyce. She was hardly more than a child, even now,
and he had dealt with her as though she were a woman of
mature views and settled philosophy. He had taken her
too seriously. They had both been too serious about their
“opinions”—as if they mattered!</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his tramp across the war zone, the vision of Joyce
as she was when he first knew her, and dreamed of her,
here in France, came back to him—her flower-like beauty,
her grace, her elegance, her courage, her vitality. He wiped
out all his quarrel with her. He believed, with increasing
certainty, that after this separation, and his change in character—he
felt that he had both changed and strengthened
and become better balanced—a meeting between them would
end in reconciliation and understanding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He regretted his answers to her letters, so harsh and
humourless. He would go to her in Paris, and say, “My
dear, I want your love again. I have dedicated my life
to love—and peace, which is the fruit of love. I am your
faithful serving-man. What stands between our happiness
together?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At night, lying on a truckle bed in the “<span class='it'>Fleur des
Champs</span>” or the “<span class='it'>Estaminet des Poilus</span>,” he yearned for
Joyce with the home-sickness of a boy away in a cheerless
school. Her physical presence seemed to be with him. He
was aware sometimes of the perfume of her hair, he could
almost feel the silky touch of those “bobbed” curls. He
spoke her name, waking in the morning, in day-dreams,
and saw her walking with bare feet across the grass that
grew so green now over the battlefields.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even his jealousy of Kenneth Murless abated, and died
out, extinguished by this larger sense that had come to
him. Kenneth had been her playmate as a child. His
comradeship had been above suspicion, except in the mind
of that other Bertram, with nerves on edge, and petty
egotism all alarmed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in this mood of exalted emotion that Bertram
stepped out of the Gare du Nord and drove in a rattle-bone
taxi down the dreary length of the rue Lafayette to the
heart of Paris and the Hotel Meurice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram made his way through a group of Americans
with a quickening pulse. His eyes roved about this entrance
hall, expecting to see Joyce at once, waiting for his coming,
as it were. It was one of the tall American girls who
gave him a start and made him take a pace forward with
the word “Joyce!” on his lips, though unuttered. She was
a tall, slim girl, with glistening gold hair, in a cream-coloured
French frock, such as Joyce would wear in a
Paris June. She turned round to say a word to a friend,
and he had a sense of disappointment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the desk he enquired for Lady Joyce Pollard, and as
an afterthought, for the Countess of Ottery. The clerk
glanced at him doubtfully—he was wearing an old grey
suit and a soft hat—and then informed him that both ladies
had left Paris the day before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where have they gone?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was profoundly disappointed now, and cursed himself
for not having written or telegraphed from Amiens to announce
his coming. His hopes had been so high and soaring
about his meeting with Joyce that this check was intolerable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clerk shrugged his shoulders and smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can I tell, monsieur? Paris is the gate to all the
Continent!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely they left an address?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clerk looked up in a book. No, the ladies had not
left any address. He condescended to send for the Hall
Porter, a superb person in a claret-coloured uniform. The
Hall Porter himself condescended to inform the rather
shabby-looking Englishman that “Madame la Comtesse
d’Ottery” and Miladi, her daughter, had departed by automobile
to Amiens. He understood they proposed to visit
the battlefields in the British war-zone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram could obtain no further information, and when
he walked down the rue de Rivoli, the serenity of mind
and exalted sense of sacrifice which he believed he had
acquired during lonely nights and days, departed from him
abruptly, for a few minutes at least, and he was furious
with Fortune for having played him such a scurvy trick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had just come from Amiens. Joyce had just gone
there! If he had only known that she wanted to visit the
battlefields, he could have shown her every yard of earth
that was hallowed by the struggle of British manhood—made
her see with his eyes the way of battle, taken her to
Ypres where her brothers had died, pointed out the line of
old trenches beyond which he had once stared into No-Man’s
Land, led her into the very dug-out where he had
found her letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On such a journey they would have come together again,
gone hand in hand and heart to heart, understanding the
immensity of that tragedy of death which made their own
lives in debt for ever to the youth that died. No such luck!
By twenty-four hours he had missed Joyce, and this chance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had the idea of taking the first train back to Amiens,
and tracing them from there, but he reflected that in an
automobile they would be lost to him, and that his best
chance of quickest meeting would be to await Joyce’s return
to Paris. He would be able to find out her plans from
Murless, at the British Embassy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram dumped his one bag in a small hotel in the
rue St. Honoré—he couldn’t afford the Hotel Meurice—and
walked to the Embassy in the Faubourg St. Honoré.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth Murless, to whom he sent in his card, kept him
waiting for ten minutes, and in spite of that self-rebuke
which had softened his feelings so recently towards Kenneth,
this delay strained his temper and aroused his old sense
of hostility, according to the natural law which makes all
men hate those who keep them in antechambers, even as
Dr. Johnson hated Lord Chesterfield and dipped his pen
in venom to take vengeance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door opened, and light footsteps crossed the polished
boards. Bertram turned and saw Kenneth Murless, and
was aware that, for just the fraction of a second, Kenneth
had a startled look, almost a look of fear. It passed instantly
into a welcoming smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Bertram! Fearfully sorry for keeping you
waiting. The Ambassador is as garrulous as an old maid
this morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he made the <span class='it'>amende honorable</span>, holding out his hand
to Bertram with the friendliest gesture. Then he sat on
the edge of a Louis Quinze table, and offered Bertram a
cigarette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s Joyce?” asked Bertram, abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth did not seem quite sure at the moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wafted away to a château in Picardy, I believe. Yes,
I understand she’s staying a while with the old Marquis
de Plumoison and his charming daughter, Yvonne, to say
nothing of Jérome, the young and handsome Vicomte.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These names meant something to Bertram. Once, in
time of war, he had been billeted for two months outside
the Château de Plumoison, and with kind permission of the
old Marquis, had shot rabbits in the park. He remembered
Yvonne de Plumoison, and her kindness to young British
officers like himself. Most of them had fallen in love with
her for a week or two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about Lady Ottery?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gone for one night only, en route for merry England,
where your worthy father-in-law is suffering from that
vulgar complaint, influenza. But, my dear fellow, don’t
you get the family bulletin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been wandering,” said Bertram. He flushed deeply
at Kenneth’s question, and couldn’t tell whether it held an
underlying sarcasm, or was asked in simplicity. Perhaps
Joyce hadn’t told Kenneth how hideously they had quarrelled
that night at Holme Ottery, nor how complete had
been their estrangement. It would be like Joyce to keep
her own counsel, and put a gay face upon their separation.
And yet she was so intimate in friendship with Kenneth that
if any man knew, he would. In any case he must have
guessed, known, indeed, without guessing, that “something”
had happened to bring Joyce to Paris without her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come and dine with me to-night,” said Kenneth. “I’m
entertaining a few friends at the Griffon, a chic little place
round the corner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in this rig-out,” said Bertram, glancing at his
shabby clothes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murless pooh-poohed that reason.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any old dress does nowadays. Besides, I’ll introduce
you as a literary man. You’ll be adored by the women.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He congratulated Bertram on his essays in <span class='it'>The New
World</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve quite a touch! Guy de Maupassant has a rival.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Bertram suspected irony, but Kenneth looked at
him in his friendliest way, disarming hostility, and his next
words were kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was deeply shocked to hear of your mother’s death;
and Digby. Please accept my sympathy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he gave Bertram another piece of news, striking in
its unexpectedness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way, your sister is in Paris. Poor pretty Susan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By that word “poor” he revealed his knowledge of that
tragedy in Mountjoy Prison. He had met her in the
Tuileries gardens, with another girl. He had raised his hat
to her, but she had looked through his body for a thousand
miles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram was astonished, yet a sense of relief came to
him at the news. It was better for Susan to be in Paris
than in Dublin. Safer. But how to find her? Kenneth
could give no clue, and Bertram, having come to Paris to
find Joyce, was in the strange case of a man who had
missed his wife and lost a sister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He accepted Kenneth’s invitation to dinner because of
that loneliness, and sense of futility, but he hadn’t left
the Embassy more than half an hour when, by a fluke of
chance, he came face to face with Susan in the Place de la
Concorde. She was just entering the “Metro” when he
saw her, and grabbed her arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Susan! What luck to find you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last time he had met her came back to his mind in
a flash—that day in Sackville Street, when her hair was
unkempt and her eyes were red and wild, and her frock
was wet and muddy after an all-night vigil. Now she was
neat and pretty again, but the memory of that night had
not passed from her face. In her eyes was still something
of its pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo, Bertram!” she said, as simply and unemotionally
as though they had left each other only an hour ago. As
he drew her on one side to avoid the stream of people
pouring into the Underground station, she showed sufficient
interest in his way of life to ask what he was doing
in Paris. He answered her vaguely, and asked the same
question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are <span class='it'>you</span> doing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She, too, was vague, and said something about propaganda
work, for Ireland. The French were sympathetic.
They believed in Liberty, and they hated England, she was
glad to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They don’t seem to like us,” said Bertram, sadly, but
he didn’t argue with that “glad to say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When can I have a real talk with you, and where?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave her address, at a number in the rue de la Pompe,
Passy, and told him that she was living with Betty O’Brien,
who, like herself, had abandoned England since Dennis’s
martyrdom. Betty was staying with her uncle, Mr.
Mahony. Any time after nine he would find a little crowd
in their rooms. Irish exiles, French Liberals, Russian Communists,
some of the people in France who most loved
Liberty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A rum crowd!” thought Bertram, but to his sister he
said, “I’ll come to-night at ten, if that’s not too late?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any time before midnight, or afterwards,” said Susan,
smiling for the first time. “They’re all talkers. You’ll
learn a lot, if you’re not too aggressively English.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joyce thinks I’m not English enough,” he answered,
and at the name of Joyce Susan’s black eyes flashed, and
her mouth hardened. She remembered that scene with the
telephone—the prelude of tragedy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Au revoir</span>, then. Until this evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She fell in with the crowd of business men, <span class='it'>midinettes</span>,
students, Americans, school-girls, who passed unceasingly
through the little iron gates which led down to the “Metro”
tubes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram lunched alone at a <span class='it'>terrasse</span> restaurant, on the
other side of the river in the Boulevard St. Michel. A
French girl sat opposite, at the same little table, and entered
into conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Anglais?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Oui. Vous voyez!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Pas Americain, alors!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Moitié Anglais, moitié Irlandais, pour le dire précisément.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She told him that she preferred the Irish half of him.
For the English she had lost her love, on account of that
monster, “Loy-Zhorzhe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram groaned a little, and laughed a little, and begged
her not to discuss politics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She expressed the opinion that nothing mattered in life,
except politics, because they dictated life. It was on account
of politics that she paid three francs fifty for a bad
<span class='it'>déjeuner</span>, instead of one franc seventy-five as in the good
days before the war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before she had obtained three francs fifty worth of vile
food, he learnt that she was a stenographer to a music
publisher in the rue des Saints Pères, that her brother
had been killed (like all the others) at Verdun, and that
she had a lover who was a clerk in the Crédit Lyonnais.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She approached the subject of politics again, when she
affirmed that Paris had lost its gaiety because of high
prices. And high prices prevailed because the <span class='it'>sales Boches</span>
refused to pay their reparations, much encouraged by England
and America, for reasons she failed to understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite simple reasons,” said Bertram. “Because England
and America are persuaded that Germany’s bankruptcy
would be the worst thing for Europe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>O, la, la! Je m’en fiche de l’Europe! Qu’est-ce-qu’il
y a pour la France qui est tellement épuisée par l’agonie et
l’outrage de la guerre?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She didn’t care a jot for Europe. What did that have
to do with France, agonised and outraged by war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave a little gloved hand to Bertram, and thanked
him for his conversation, before going back to her music-shop.
She forgave him for being half English because he
was altogether charming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That encounter meant nothing in Bertram’s life, except
relief from half an hour’s loneliness, and one more proof
among a thousand, of the alarming dislike of England in
France after war. What did it portend? It frightened
him, and sickened him. Not in that was the spirit and
chance of peace to which he had dedicated his brain and
heart. How could a bridge be built over this widening
gulf between the French and British foundations of faith
for the future of Europe?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question remained unanswered in Bertram’s mind,
as he wandered about Paris, disconsolate and lonely—enormously
lonely now that he had failed to meet Joyce—until
it was time to join Kenneth’s party at the Griffon.</p>

<div><h1>XLII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>He was the last to arrive, and Kenneth presented him
to a young husband and wife whose names and portraits,—the
Baron and Madame de Montauban—he had
seen in many illustrated journals devoted to “Society”
news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>De Montauban was a well-known amateur tennis player,
he remembered, and he seemed to be an amiable, vivacious
fellow, with easy manners. His wife was one of the prettiest
women Bertram had seen in Paris where there is no
dearth of beauty—fresher, more “English,” as he was
pleased to think, than the typical Parisienne. Her complexion
was almost as Nature had made it, and she had soft
brown eyes, with a very charming way with them, but frank
and unaffected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth’s other guests were the Vicomte and Madame
Armand St. Pierre de Vaux, both of whom attracted Bertram
with peculiar interest. The husband had lost his left
arm and part of his left leg at the first battle of the Marne,
but crippled as he was, he showed an astonishing gaiety
of spirit, and his lean face, with a little black moustache,
and dark, luminous eyes, seemed to Bertram like that of
D’Artagnan, the adored hero of his boyhood. His wife
was a “<span class='it'>belle laide</span>,” plain but elegant, and with adoring
eyes for her crippled man whom she treated half as a
lover and half as a baby, fondling his hand, cutting up his
meat, laughing at his anecdotes as though she heard them
for the first time, and rebuking him for raising his voice
too loud in a public restaurant. To these attentions her
husband responded with whimsical affection, like a small
boy with his mother, whom he adores though she tries his
patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth was a good host, speaking French perfectly,
with a Parisian accent which Bertram found a little hard
to follow—as he had learnt French colloquially among the
peasants and bourgeoisie of Picardy—and leading the
conversation as easily and gracefully as in a London drawing-room.
Now and then, Bertram was aware of Kenneth’s
glance upon him, once or twice met his eyes and saw in
them a kind of embarrassment, like that startled look which
he had given for just a second at their meeting that morning
in the Faubourg St. Honoré. But it was only the faintest
hint of uneasiness for some unknown cause, and was no
more than a shadow which left no trace in the sparkle of
his conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The table was laid for six, with Kenneth at one end and
Armand de Vaux at the other. Bertram had the privilege
of sitting on the left of Mme. de Montauban, who was next
to Kenneth. Opposite were the Vicomte de Montauban,
and Mme. de Vaux—admirably arranged according to the
convention that husbands and wives must be kept as far
apart as possible when they eat in public.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a little general discussion as to the impossibility
of getting good food in Paris after the war, even at
outrageous prices, due mainly to the profiteering of Parisian
middlemen. Presently Mme. de Montauban turned to
Bertram and speaking English with pretty accent, “felicitated”
him on the possession of so beautiful a wife, whom
she had had the pleasure of meeting several times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram’s mind winced a little at that word “possession,”
but he merely asked where Mme. de Montauban had happened
to meet Joyce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She seemed a little surprised at that question, and her
glance flickered for a moment in the direction of Kenneth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everywhere in Paris,” she answered, with her beautiful
smile. “She has made many friends among us because
of her love, so very great, for our dear France.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Tiens!</span>” said Armand de Vaux, on the other side of
Bertram, “Monsieur is the husband of Miladi Joyce! She
is exquisite! An English rose! Monsieur will pardon me
if I confess that I fell desperately in love with her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s impossible to avoid that tribute!” said Kenneth.
“Bertram Pollard knows that all his friends are the slaves
of his wife’s beauty. Isn’t it so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke in French, and his words sounded <span class='it'>chevale</span><span class='it'>resque</span>
and romantic, with a lighter touch than they would
have had in English. At that “Is it not so?” he looked at
Bertram, and their eyes met. Kenneth’s smile seemed a
little quizzing, as though he knew his friend’s quick jealousy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram felt no kind of objection to Armand de Vaux’s
declaration of “desperate love,” though he was conscious
of some secret reaction to Kenneth’s endorsement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad Joyce is so much admired,” he said simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Armand de Vaux paid a tribute to English womanhood.
Most of his knowledge of English character, as a young
man, had been gained from reading translations of Shakespeare
during his <span class='it'>service militaire</span> in the barracks at
Belfont. He had fallen in love with Rosalind, Beatrice,
and Katherine, above all with Beatrice, who was, he
thought, essentially English and Elizabethan. But he believed
from better evidence than that of reading, that
English womanhood had retained that Elizabethan quality
of character—frankness, simplicity, courage, and above all,
a playfulness of spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mme. de Vaux tapped her husband’s hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None of your amorous reminiscences here, Armand.
Every one knows that you are a monster of infidelity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before marriage I was a romantic,” he admitted with
simple self-satisfaction. “Since marriage I have been a
model of single-hearted devotion. It is still possible, however,
that I may one day sow my last peck of wild oats.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This menace caused great laughter from De Montauban,
and his wife, and Kenneth rewarded the audacity of De
Vaux, in the presence of his wife—who seemed in no way
perturbed—by filling up the glasses of his guests with another
bottle of Veuve Clicquot, and drinking to the exploits
of D’Artagnan—“Twenty Years After.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mme. de Montauban ventured to accuse Shakespeare of
tremendous plagiarism from Boccaccio and the Italian
<span class='it'>novelli</span>, and there were vivacious passages of arms between
her and Kenneth, in the course of which they quoted Italian
poets at each other, so leaving Bertram for a while outside
the conversation, as he was ignorant of that language.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Armand de Vaux had a tête-à-tête with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You fought in France, I have no doubt, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Somme, Flanders, Cambrai,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And still with both legs and both arms! That is wonderful.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
You see I lost two limbs in the Great War.
I do not regret them. What beautiful memories of comradeship
and laughter, and immense valour! The best years
of our lives!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke with absolute sincerity, and with a new light
in his eyes, as though seeing with enthusiasm the vision of
his fighting days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The comradeship was good,” said Bertram, “but the
price was too great for that. Why not comradeship without
war?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Pas possible!</span> It needs war and the chance of death to
bring out the great qualities of men. Laughter is best when
it is in the midst of danger as a shield against fear. <span class='it'>Mon
Dieu!</span> how I laughed in those days!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He told some anecdotes of war. How the “popote” or
mess had been destroyed by a German shell when they were
ravenous with hunger after a long march to Ablain St.
Nazaire; how they had killed a German sergeant-major
and two men, luring them into No-Man’s Land by driving
a lean pig through the barbed wire at dawn; how they had
made a camouflage tree on the Arras-Lens road and sniped
Germans like rabbits before they spotted it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was enormously amused at his own efforts to get
wounded. No wound, no decoration, was the custom in
the French army, as far as the fighting men were concerned.
Of course, at the back of the front, any little cock sparrow
at Headquarters or the Base, could cover his breast with
ribbons. But in the front line the only chance of distinction
was a wound. For a long time he’d had the vilest luck.
All his friends were wounded—and decorated. He remained
without a scratch, and without a medal. The
Colonel regarded him suspiciously, said he bore “a charmed
life,” as though he indulged in some private Juju to keep
immune from shell-fire and snipers’ bullets, aerial torpedoes,
trench mortars, hand grenades, and the whole “bag
of tricks.” The situation became serious. He walked in a
veritable hail of shrapnel and nothing hit him. He made
a home of No-Man’s Land at night, leading patrols, but no,
the Boche ignored him. One day, in Arras, a monstrous
aerial torpedo made straight for him. “Ah, ha, my friend!
At last you are going to do my trick!” But the <span class='it'>sacré</span>
torpedo was a dud, and fell at his very feet without exploding!
<span class='it'>Quelle mauvaise chance!</span> What infernal bad
luck! However, fortune’s wheel turned at last, and in the
battle of the Somme, on the right of the British, he lost
his arm and leg and gained the <span class='it'>Médaille Militaire</span>, and the
<span class='it'>Croix de Guerre</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram joined in his gay laughter. This little French
aristocrat was not posing, nor indulging in vainglorious
boasting. He had loved the adventure of war, and found
in it compensations for all its abominations and its tragedy
of great death. A thousand years of ancestry had given
him this instinct of war. Its spirit belonged to his blood.
He was of the same race and quality as Amadis de Gaul,
Roland, Bertrand du Guesclin, the Sieurs de Morny, the
Knights of Froissart’s noble Chronicles. Old Christy would
have voted for his death—theoretically—as a “carrier” of
the war-microbe, as some people are typhoid carriers,
infecting all who come in contact with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you don’t agree with <span class='it'>Le Feu</span>, by Barbusse, as a
true picture of the war from the <span class='it'>poilu’s</span> point of view?”
asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Armand de Vaux “went off,” like a trench mortar. He
denounced that book—the most terrible picture of war’s
horror, which Bertram had read before writing his own—as
the work of a traitor to France, as revolutionary propaganda
of the vilest kind, an outrage upon the valour of
the French soldier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram was silent, not caring to risk a dispute at this
table, but pretty Mme. de Montauban expressed her own
opinion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had a nephew at Souchez and Notre Dame de Lorette—Pierre,
as you remember? He tells me that Barbusse
has given an exact picture of those trenches in the winter
of ’15. The men were not relieved, month after month.
They lived and ate and slept and died, in mud and filth.
Some of them went mad, and others walked out into No-Man’s
Land to end their misery by a German bullet. You
remember only the amusing side of war, Vicomte! It is
your temperament. In my hospital at Neuilly I saw too
much tragedy to believe in your romance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bah!” said the Vicomte de Vaux. “Tragedy? Death?
They are part of life, in peace as well as war. ‘A little
laughter, a little love .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and then good night!’ What
more can we ask, except a good fight? <span class='it'>Vive la Guerre!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mme. de Montauban laughed, and shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is the language of the eighteenth century. You
speak that tongue, I know. You belong to that period.
But for us moderns there is no truth in it. War has nearly
destroyed our dear France. Another—and we die!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall have another,” said Armand de Vaux. “I
shall weep to be out of it, with only one leg and one arm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why shall we have another?” asked Bertram, and a
little chill crept down his spine, because of the calm and
certain way in which the little Vicomte had made that statement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was the Baron de Montauban who answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely,” he said, leaning forward a little, to flick the
ash of his cigarette into a bowl of flowers, “you are aware
that your Lloyd George arranges another for us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your Lloyd George!” Bertram had heard that phrase
from peasants, chambermaids, commercial travellers, shop-girls,
the typist-secretary of a music publisher. He did
not expect to hear it from a French aristocrat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth made a protest, in his graceful way, deprecating
unpleasant themes, except when he happened to lead the
argument in his best manner as a one-time President of
the Oxford Union.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As office-boy at the British Embassy, I hesitate to listen
to accusations against my Prime Minister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Armand de Vaux laughed heartily at this diplomatic
statement, and said he had no more respect for Ministers
of France than for Ministers of England. They were all
politicians, playing to their respective galleries. As a
soldier and a Royalist he despised them as <span class='it'>canaille</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>De Montauban pursued his idea relentlessly, despite this
interlude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I say your Lloyd George is arranging another
war for France, I mean all that body of opinion in Great
Britain which calls itself Liberal. <span class='it'>Mon Dieu!</span> In their
desire to be fair to the Germans—one might as well be fair
to his Majesty the Devil!—and in their anxiety to trade
again with their former enemy, they utterly ignore the
French point of view.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is that?” asked Bertram, anxious to discover
whether the Baron de Montauban could give him more
light than the peasants of the old battlefields.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have only one point of view, and one demand,” said
de Montauban. “Security! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Security for France, after
her sacrifice and her victory. Where is that assurance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the ‘<span class='it'>tapage</span>’ of our ‘<span class='it'>soixante-quinzes</span>!’ ” said Armand
de Vaux.</p>

<p class='pindent'>De Montauban shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us not deceive ourselves. We are not strong enough
to fight alone against the <span class='it'>Boche</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have Poland as a gallant ally.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She will crumple like pasteboard between Germany and
Russia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Belgium, Czecho-Slovakia, Hungary,” said De Vaux.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must have England and the United States,” said De
Montauban. “It was they who made us sheathe our sword
and abandon our full and just right of vengeance against
Germany in the Treaty of Versailles. We compromised in
return for a pledge of security from our allies. That pledge
was broken before the signature was dry on the Treaty.
The Americans refused to ratify the pledge of their President.
It was our first betrayal. Since then, by a sentimental
illusion of world peace, all our rights have been betrayed.
The Germans have been encouraged to evade their
reparation payments, though without them France is bankrupt.
When we threaten to march into the Ruhr to enforce
those payments, the Liberals of England cry ‘Shame’ on
us for provoking the poor dear Germans. What will be
the end of it? It is almost in sight. The Entente will be
broken between England and France. Germany will ally
herself with Russia, with whom also the English Liberals
are sentimentalising, and France will within the present
generation be called upon to defend her soil again, without
Great Britain by her side. It is inevitable. It is certain.
It is the Great Betrayal. That is why we hate your Lloyd
George, and all he stands for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The English people are loyal to us,” said Mme. de
Montauban. She turned to Bertram, and laid her little
hand on his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are sure that the real heart of England beats with
us, after so much common sacrifice, so much agony together.
Is it not so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is true,” said Bertram, “I thank you for having said
so, Madame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found himself speaking emotionally, with a kind of
passion in his voice, which he tried to control.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since I’ve been in France, wandering about, I have
heard nothing but the French point of view. I agree with
it a good deal. I am a lover of France. But there’s another
point of view.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?” asked De Montauban, politely, but with a hint of
sarcasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. It’s the English point of view. That of the common
man, the ‘Tommy’ who fought in France.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?” asked De Montauban again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it pretty well. You would like to hear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell us!” said Mme. de Montauban.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s just this. He doesn’t believe in kicking a man
when he’s down, even a German. And he does believe that
another war will happen if France presses Germany too
hard. He doesn’t want another war, because he has two
million comrades out of work as a result of the last, and
the trade of England is ruined already. He wants peace,
and he thinks the way to get it is by a union of European
peoples, forgetting hatred, and no longer grouping into
different Alliances, defensive or aggressive. He believes in
a League of Nations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then he believes in monstrous illusion,” said De Montauban,
very coldly, and Bertram thought of the French
priest who banged his fist on the table with the cry of
“Illusion!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speaking as a soldier,” said Armand de Vaux, “I see no
safety for France or England, except in the power of their
artillery. And I would give the luxury of this very charming
dinner to sit in the mud again and hear the <span class='it'>rafale</span> of
the <span class='it'>soixante-quinzes</span> pounding the <span class='it'>Boche</span> to bits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a bloodthirsty ogre!” said his wife, caressing his
only hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a despiser of my poor little banquet,” said Kenneth,
ordering some more Veuve Clicquot, and very artfully
inviting an interruption of waiters, to change the drift
of conversation which abandoned politics for a discussion
on the psychology of “jazz,” led by the beautiful Mme. de
Montauban, in reference to the efforts of the orchestra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth had to return to the Embassy at ten o’clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mme. de Montauban and her husband were going to a
reception by the Duchesse d’Uzès. It was this lady who
rose first, with a smile at Mme. de Vaux who accepted the
signal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other little parties in the restaurant paid tribute to
her beauty with their eyes, as Bertram helped to put her
cloak on her shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave him her hand with a charming friendship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand your English point of view,” she said.
“It is a little dangerous, I think. The English heart is
greater than the English head!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she leaned forward to him, smiling, and spoke in
a low voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not leave your wife alone too much. She is too
beautiful! That is more important than politics—if you
love her beauty!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In another moment she was gone, with a rustle of silk
and a gracious smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram was alarmed by those words of hers. Were
they merely “French” in their general sentiment, or a particular
warning? They disturbed him profoundly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He walked with Kenneth through the Marché St. Honoré
as far as the Embassy. Kenneth seemed talkative, discussing
those friends of his, as though wishing to avoid other
topics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram broke in across one of his subtleties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve seen a good deal of Joyce lately?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For just a second—no more than that—Kenneth hesitated
in his reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Longchamps—the Bois—the opera, and so on, in
the usual way. It’s been beautiful weather lately, don’t
you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram was silent. He was not interested in the
weather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know that Joyce and I have not seen things altogether
eye to eye lately? She told you that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth again hesitated before his answer, as though
weighing his words with diplomatic caution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was aware of some misunderstanding.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But if
you’ll allow me to say so, I never discuss relations between
husband and wife. Don’t you think that’s a good rule?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke in his friendliest way, but his rebuke, as it
seemed, made Bertram flush deeply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no intention of discussing my relations with
Joyce. I merely desired to thank you for having been a
good friend to her during my absence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth laughed, in a queer, strained way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear fellow! No need for thanks.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I try to
play the game, according to the rules.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He raised his hand with a gesture that was almost a
salute, and disappeared into the British Embassy.</p>

<div><h1>XLIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Mahony, the uncle of Betty O’Brien, with whom
Susan was staying, lived in an apartment on the
upper floor of a house in the shabby end of the rue de la
Pompe, out at Passy, by “Metro” from the Place de la
Concorde.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Quatrième à gauche</span>”—fourth floor on the left—was the
direction given to Bertram by the concierge, an enormous
man who was wedged with his almost equally fat wife in
a little room on the ground floor with a glass window
through which he could observe those who came and went.
He added to his information by the surly remark that Bertram
would find the right door by the abominable noise that
issued from it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What kind of noise?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The noise of anarchists, monsieur. All talking treason
to France and to civilisation. I may consider it my duty
to inform the police.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A prudent idea,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled at the lowering face of the Colossus through
the glass window with its dirty lace curtains, and then went
up four flights of a staircase which smelt abominably of
drains and onions. The plaster on the walls was crumbling
off in scabby patches, and the doors to the right and left
on each landing needed new paint, badly. The door on
the fourth floor to the left had a broken bellrope tied up
with a string, and when Bertram tugged it, there was a
sound inside like the jangle of a Bulgarian cow-bell.
Through a slit in the door came the murmur of several
voices, but nothing that could fairly be described as “an
abominable noise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door was opened to him by Susan, a pale Susan,
with no Irish roses in her cheeks, as he noticed when he
kissed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you’ve come!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spoke quietly, with no enthusiasm, but then, at the
kiss of the brother who once had been her close comrade,
her coldness to him seemed to melt, and putting both her
hands on his shoulders and her face against his coat, she
began to cry a little, silently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter, Sister Susie?” he whispered, while
from the end of the passage came the sound of vivacious
conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t everything in the world the matter?” she asked,
and then dried her tears in a comical way with the back of
her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you come out to some café and have a quiet talk?
I don’t feel like ‘company’ to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She told him she wanted him to meet Betty’s uncle and
her good friend, Mr. Mahony, and led him by the hand into
a shabbily furnished room, dimly lit by oil lamps, where
Bertram saw Betty O’Brien, who rose and gave him her
hand, and an elderly man with white hair, a clean-shaven,
rather priestly face, and very blue eyes, in which there was
a look of humour and benevolence. He was sitting back
in a low chair, with broken leather, through which the stuffing
protruded, talking in a philosophical strain to three
young men, obviously Irish, who were sitting about the
room smoking cigarettes. Bertram heard him say something
about the need of sacrifice for sacred principles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A man who won’t die for a principle sins against the
light.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle,” said Betty O’Brien, “be hanged to your principles
for a minute. This is Susan’s brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Mahony rose, and grasped Bertram’s hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Susan’s brother! Then a friend of Ireland.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Half an Irishman, and a good friend,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet before the evening was at an end, his friendship for
Ireland was put to a heavy strain again. Mr. Mahony,
with his white hair, and blue benevolent eyes, and the three
young Irishmen to whom he addressed most of his monologues,
made no disguise of their implacable hatred of
England. It was not that they denounced England with
any violence of language, but rather the deadly coldness,
and the kind of loathing, with which they spoke the very
name of England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Worse than that was their contempt. It was plain that
they had the fixed belief that the British Government in
Ireland was “on the run.” The Irish Republican army
was succeeding with its policy of secret warfare. In one
week they had killed five British officers and twenty men.
They had raided the barracks, seized great quantities of
arms, and organised a number of successful ambushes.
There were large districts in Ireland into which the Black
and Tans dared not penetrate. The British troops were
getting nerve-rattled and demoralised. It was obvious by
the Government answers to questions in the House of
Commons that that was very much the psychological state
of “His Majesty’s Ministers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three young Irishmen, smoking French cigarettes
interminably, had all been officers of the I. R. A., and had
escaped to France when things had become too “hot” for
them. One of them, named O’Malley, a handsome, dark-eyed
fellow rather like Dennis O’Brien, but with brighter,
more humorous eyes, described his adventures as an escaped
prisoner from Mountjoy, where he had been under sentence
of death after capture in an ambush near Cork. The Black
and Tans had searched the countryside for him, and all
the time he was selling eggs in the market-place disguised
as a “colleen,” and so seductive in appearance that an English
officer had given him the glad eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Mahony turned to Bertram and whispered a few
words about O’Malley, with a smile of admiration and
pride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“England will never defeat Ireland with that spirit
against her! O’Malley is like all the boys—just laughs at
death. It was he who executed the British officer who
gave the order to fire on the people in the Celtic Football
ground—the bloody villain!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram felt a little cold chill creep down his spine.
These people here were the enemies of England. Some of
them, like O’Malley, had killed British officers, not in open
fighting, but by cold murder, under the name of “execution.”
And they were proud of their exploits, with bright,
humorous eyes, not conscience-stricken, as men with red
crimes on their hands, but as men who had done well in the
cause of some divine ideal. They used even the name of
God with a sense of alliance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God is working for Ireland,” said Mr. Mahony. “The
sacrifice of our boys is not ignored by Him who died on
the Cross to save mankind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram felt the blood surge to his brain at these words.
He wanted to stand up and denounce them as blasphemy.
To him it was inconceivable that a man like Mahony, a
gentleman, a mild-eyed man, a good Catholic, could defend
the Sicilian methods of the Irish Republicans in the very
name of Christ—who spoke words of peace and pity, who
said “Thou shalt not kill,” whose Gospel was Love. He
half rose from his chair to make a violent and passionate
protest, when the words were taken from him by a newcomer,
brought into the room by Betty O’Brien.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle—here is Mr. Lajeunesse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man who bore the name of “Youth” was an old
gentleman of seventy or more, with a shock of grey hair
and a pointed beard, and a delicate, life-worn face. His
eyes, surrounded by a thousand wrinkles, twinkled with
the light of irony, and it was with irony that he greeted
Mr. Mahony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hear you mention the name of Christ, my dear friend!
Doubtless you are quoting the Master’s words to defend
militarism and the right of assassination in special cases?
During the Great War, when we murdered each other
wholesale, Christianity was of great value to Army Commanders,
on both sides of the line. I think the Germans
were most successful in using Christ as a propagandist
among the troops. But we did pretty well with the same
idea.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Good evening, Miss Susy! My little Irish rose
still blooms in Paris?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man kissed the girl on both cheeks with the
privilege of his years, but also with the gallantry of a
Frenchman who pays homage to beauty. And Susan’s
roses deepened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three young Irishmen had left their chairs when he
entered. They bowed low over his hand and Mr. Mahony
addressed him as <span class='it'>cher maître</span>, and did not resent his irony.
It was Eugène Lajeunesse, and Bertram felt a thrill at
being in the presence of a man whose books, so wise, so
witty, so wicked, so full of tenderness to humanity, and
yet so cruel in tearing down the faith of simple folk, had
made him famous throughout the world. Alone in France
during the War, he had maintained his faith as an international
pacifist, and not all the outrages of <span class='it'>Les Boches</span>,
nor all the agony of France had made him swerve from
the belief that the war was only one more proof of human
stupidity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He brought with him a young Frenchman, blind in one
eye and partly paralysed, it seemed, on one side, so that he
walked with difficulty, using a stick, but wonderfully vivacious
and good-humoured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eugène Lajeunesse introduced him to the company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aristide de Méricourt. You know his name and work?
If there is any hope for our poor old Europe, which is <span class='it'>in
extremis mortuis</span>, it lies in the success of this young man
and his band of brothers. They are working for international
peace and universal brotherhood. What audacity!
What sublime hope in a world that is digging new entrenchments
of hate!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We make a little progress,” said the young man with
the blind eye. “From all parts of France youth which saw
life in the trenches is joining our League against Militarism.
The Old Men are becoming afraid of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As one of the Old Men, I am not afraid of you,” said
Lajeunesse, smiling at his young friend. “I recognise your
right to declare a spiritual warfare against all old imbeciles
who are preparing for another massacre—the last
before cilivisation dies—in the fields of Europe. Gladly
would I die to-night to see youth gain its victory over old
age, old ideas, old villainies, old hatreds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not among the Old Men, <span class='it'>cher maître</span>,” said
Aristide de Méricourt; “You are Lajeunesse—Youth itself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man laughed, and shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I pose as the champion of youth. It is my vanity—to
keep young in mind and soul. Alas, I am convicted of
senility because of my cynical doubts of youth’s adventure.
Civilisation is too sick to be saved, and Poincaré, and all
the Poincarés and reactionaries of Europe, are determined
on its doom. How many men and boys have you in your
League against Militarism?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three thousand,” said Aristide de Méricourt, with an
air of pride. “Our membership is spreading in England,
Germany, Italy, even in Austria. We are truly international.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three thousand young men pledged to international
peace! That is a beginning. It is excellent. But you have
three hundred million souls to convert. The odds are
heavy, dear child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall win,” said the young man with the blind eye.
“Democracy is solid against the spirit of war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eugène Lajeunesse laughed quietly, as at a child who
talks of killing dragons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us put it a little to the test. Here in this company
of intellectuals are several young Irishmen. Are they for
or against militarism—after the war to end war? I have
heard something of a little bloodshed in Ireland—or is it
only a rumour? They are Catholics and Christians. Beautiful
is the simplicity of Irish faith! Have they abandoned
the use of Force as a way of argument? Do they believe
in Universal brotherhood, among nations and peoples? Or
are they using the bomb and the revolver to break away
from brotherhood with a nation to whom they are bound
in blood, to entrench themselves more narrowly in national
isolation? Tell me, little ones. I am an ignorant old man!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They told him at some length, and with passionate argument.
Mr. Mahoney said that the international ideal must
be based first of all on national liberty, that universal
brotherhood presupposed justice between one people and
another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Aristide de Méricourt, who interested Bertram
most, for he was the immediate opposite in ideals and convictions
of Armand de Vaux who loved the adventure of
war and believed that it developed the noblest qualities of
man. But there was something strange and sinister in the
quiet way in which this cripple denounced the existing institutions
of his own country and of western civilisation, the
national heroes of France, all the old loyalties of tradition
and faith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marshal Foch, he said, had “the soul of a grocer.” He
counted men, battalions, divisions, as so many packets.
The sacrifice of human life left him untouched, unperturbed.
Poincaré was a stuffed puppet with a squeak.
French politicians were corrupt and bought. There must
be a clean sweep of superstition—the superstition of the
Flag, of the Church, of Patriotism, of national egotism.
The democracies of the world must unite against the powers
of capitalism. France must link up with Russia for the
overthrow of all the forces of <span class='it'>bourgeois</span> stupidity and
tyranny. There must be a revolution in England and the
United States, so that Anglo-Saxon democracy might join
hands with Latin and Slav. It was the only hope of the
world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The audacity of youth!” said Lajeunesse. “Once, too,
I had those dreams! A thousand years ago!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As a Catholic Irishman I disagree with such revolutionary
gospel,” said Mr. Mahony, but there was benevolent
tolerance in his blue eyes for the heresy of the younger
man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram pleaded with his sister for a little private talk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All this discussion is very interesting, no doubt, but no
good to me. I want to know what you’re doing and going
to do. I want to tell you Of my own troubles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joyce?” she asked, and he wondered how much she
knew of that trouble, his greatest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went out to a café close by, and took a seat in a
far corner away from a group of men drinking with painted
women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Susan shivered a little, and drew her cloak close about
her though it was warm in the café, and oppressive with the
smell of cheap wine, black coffee, and stale tobacco.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t look well,” said Bertram. “Is anything
wrong with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The price of womanhood,” she said. “I’m going to have
a baby. The child of a man hanged by the English because
he loved Ireland. Funny, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put his hand on hers, and groaned a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My poor kid! My dear little sister!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was stricken by this news of hers, by the awful
memory it revived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Susan spoke calmly, but with a coldness that was worse
than tears or passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll call him Dennis, if it’s a boy. I’ll make him Irish
in soul and faith, as his father was. And I’ll teach him to
hate England as I hate it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram tried to take her hand again, but she pulled it
nervously away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the good of teaching hate?” he asked. “It gets
nowhere. It leads only to more tragedy, more blood, more
death. I believe in peace, and love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pap for babes!” said Susan scornfully. “Life is war.
Peace doesn’t exist. We’re all savages, and must obey the
law of the savage. Strike first and quickest, before your
enemy gets his chance. No pity, no forgiveness, no forgetfulness.
That’s my creed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was not the Master’s creed,” said Bertram. He told
his sister of the words spoken by their mother as she lay
dying. “Work for Peace!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m pledged by the promise I made then,” he said. “I’m
dedicated to work for Peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Susan’s eyes filled with tears, but she shook her head
and said it was all useless. How could there be peace when
the world was stuffed with cruelty? Could there ever be
peace between France and Germany? Never in a thousand
or a million years. Or ever between Ireland and
England, after what had happened, and was happening?
Not as long as an Irish boy lived to remember the history
of his race.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m dedicated too,” she said. “By the blood of the
man I married. In private or in public, by spoken word
and written word, I’ve pledged myself to work against
England, so that the British Empire will be dragged down
from its place, and fall in ruin. I’m only one of England’s
enemies, and a poor, weak creature, but I can put in a
word here and a word there. It all helps, and England
already has the whole world against her. France hates her
worse than Germany.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s madness and wickedness,” said Bertram. “You’re
hysterical, my dear, or I couldn’t forgive you for the words
you speak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She flared up at him, and called him a crawling sentimentalist,
who tried to make the best of both worlds and
stand on both sides of the hedge at the same time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re tricked by soppy sentiment. Just as Joyce has
tricked you. Are you still loyal to her, may I ask?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to be,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed, with a sound of mockery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a one-sided loyalty, old boy. Joyce has betrayed
you with Kenneth Murless. If she’s not his mistress, she’s
a much slandered woman. Every one thinks so in Paris.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram went cold, and stared at Susan with a kind of
horror in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Susan! In God’s name, what do you mean by that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She told him it was none of her business. But friends
of hers in Paris who knew that Joyce was her sister-in-law,
had taken it for granted that she had “run off” with Kenneth.
They were always about together, in the Bois, at
the opera, at Longchamps, in Henri’s restaurant night after
night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What else can people think when a woman leaves her
husband and comes to Paris with a man like Kenneth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She came with Lady Ottery,” said Bertram, “and what
your friends say is a damned lie. If they say so to me, I’ll
beat them into pulp.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Susan laughed again, in her mocking way. “That’s the
primitive man. Not peace and love this time, when it touches
you so closely! You’ll beat any man to pulp who slanders
Joyce—or tells the truth, maybe. But you can’t forgive an
Irishman who hates England, not for slandering his country,
but for outraging her, trampling on her face, murdering her
children! Nor a Frenchman who wants to beat Germany
to pulp! Where’s your logic, Bertram?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat silent, staring at a puddle of coffee on the marble-topped
table. What Susan said was true enough. She
had found the weak spot in his armour. His “dedication
to peace” only held good as long as it was in the abstract,
and impersonal. This accusation against Joyce, that word
“mistress” coupled with Kenneth’s name, put the instinct
of murder in his mind. If he believed the story he would
go to Kenneth and shoot him like a dog. Fortunately it
was absurd. He could afford to laugh at it. He laughed
now, harshly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Extraordinary how some women, and most Irish, have
the spirit of vendetta. Why do you hate Joyce so much
that you want to kill her reputation?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Susan rose, and left the café table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s go before we make a public brawl. It’s true I
hate Joyce. I remember a scene over a telephone one night
when she threatened to betray my man. But I hate her now
because she’s betraying you, in heart if not in body.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram took his sister back without a word, to the
apartment house in the rue de la Pompe. There he left her
with a gruff “Good night!” She had wounded him horribly
with a poisoned shaft. Her words tortured him. He
thought of her as a female Iago who had slandered another
Desdemona. And he was Othello, refusing to believe, yet
with foul suspicion gnawing at him, and making a madness
in his brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce and Kenneth! No, a million times no. And yet,
deep down in his subconsciousness had been that very toad
of evil thought. Ever since Joyce had written to him, telling
him she saw a good deal of Kenneth in Paris, he had
tried to kill this base and frightful thought which now
Susan had stated as a well known belief. “Every one
thinks so in Paris.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At nine o’clock next morning he took the train to Amiens
and, at the Hotel du Rhin, hired a motor-car and drove to
the Château de Plumoison where Joyce was staying.</p>

<div><h1>XLIV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>He remembered this old château of Picardy. It lay to
the right of the cottage where he had been billeted for
a few weeks in 1917. He had hardly thought of it since,
because that memory had been effaced by more exciting and
deadly adventure. But now, as he passed up the dirty village
where cocks and hens clustered across the roadway
and peasant women stared at him from doorways where
once British soldiers had lounged during Divisional rests
between long spells in the line, he remembered the way past
the pump, and then a sharp turn to the right by the
<span class='it'>estaminet</span> of “<span class='it'>La Véritable Coucou</span>”—that comical name
came back to him now with intimate remembrance—and so
to the long avenue of poplars leading straight through the
park to the old white house with its pointed roofs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Vicomte de Plumoison had given the run of the place
to any British officers in the neighbourhood, and Yvonne,
his daughter, had invited them to “five o’clock,” as she
called her tea-parties. She was not very beautiful, though
an elegant little lady, but it was paradise enough to sit with
any lady in any drawing-room, after long terms of servitude
in the lousy trenches, in exile from all beauty.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned through the iron gates and walked slowly up
the avenue. Somewhere in that white house was Joyce.
His heart beat at the thought, with sickening kind of thuds.
He was passionate to see her, to take her hand, to draw
her close to him, and be assured of her love after all this
foolishness of separation and estrangement. A word from
her, a straight look out of her eyes, would be enough to kill
that toad of evil still alive in the slime of suspicion, in
those base and primitive instincts of the male beast which
lurk as a heritage of cave-man ancestry in all human brains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet Welford had spoken a true thing when she said,
“Joyce is the Beatrice of your <span class='it'>Divina Commedia</span>.” In the
time of his greatest bitterness against her, when he felt most
injured by her ill-temper with him, she had been his vision,
and in his heart, inescapable. His loyalty had been strained,
but was stronger than all his weakness, and now, as he went
towards her, the thought of this girl who had given him
her beauty so generously in time of war, so recklessly, perhaps,
fevered him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He quickened his pace, and instead of going straight up
the avenue, took a winding path which led to the back of
the château by the trout stream. Perhaps it was some
mental “wave-length” which impelled him to do that instinctively,
and without conscious purpose, because, as he
made his way through a little glade, he saw Joyce a few
yards away from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a stone seat there, which he remembered. It
was underneath a grass bank with a little hollowed place
in which stood a statue of “<span class='it'>Notre Dame de Lourdes</span>,”—painted
blue and white, amidst tall growing ferns. He had
once stood there talking to Yvonne de Plumoison with a
group of officers. Joyce was alone. Her hat lay on the
seat by her side. She had a book on her lap, but she wasn’t
reading. She was weeping. At least there were tears in
her eyes when, at the sound of his footsteps on the path,
she looked quickly towards him, and then sprang up with
a cry of surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He called her name, and went forward hurriedly, with
tremendous gladness in his eyes. She looked as he had
thought of her so often. As she stood there, waiting for
him, the sunlight, shining through young leaves, touched
her hair, giving it a glory. She wore a green frock, cut low
at the neck, and looked like the Rosalind in Arden Woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She let him take her hands and kiss her, but did not
answer his passion with any warmth of greeting, so that
almost in a moment he was chilled, and saw that she had
become pale in his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s a seat,” she said. “Let’s sit and talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat beside her, holding her hand, and was struck by
its coldness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been longing for you,” he told her. “Dreaming of
you o’ nights.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She said something about his letters. They didn’t suggest
any passionate longing, she thought. He hadn’t bothered
to join her in Paris when she asked him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He asked her to “wash all that out.” He’d been a
blithering idiot. It had all been a question of jangled
nerves—the wrong perspective—egotism. He’d been thinking
things out during his loneliness. He’d killed his miserable
ego. All he wanted now was to make her happy and
to serve her. They’d made a mistake in taking things too
seriously, arguing about trivialities as though they mattered.
They’d allowed “politics” to strain their relations! It was
inconceivable, looking back on it. What kids they’d been!
He had grown up at last. No more of that sort of nonsense.
Tolerance was his watch-word. He’d come to
understand that a plain getting on with life mattered more
than theories and minor differences in points of view. Love
was the only thing worth while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean that?” asked Joyce. “Do you think, honestly,
that love over-rides everything?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every damn thing,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave him a queer glancing smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a dangerous philosophy. Sometimes it leads to
peculiar complications!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you mean?” asked Bertram. “To me it simplifies
the whole riddle. The love of a man for his mate,
through thick and thin, fine weather and foul, ‘in sickness
and in health.’—D’you remember the old words in St. Mary
Abbot’s?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I remember. I was a baby then. We were both
babes, as ignorant of life as those tits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pointed to two little birds fluttering about the branch
of a tree where they sat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But with the same share in the eternal scheme of
things,” said Bertram. “You and I went to St. Mary
Abbot’s under the same divine impulse as those two tits
set up housekeeping in the tree-top.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Joyce, “I suppose it’s over-civilisation that
has spoilt the game.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the game spoilt?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s hard to play according to the rules, sometimes. And
if we keep to the rules the fun goes out of the game. It’s
just duty. Mostly disagreeable, and sometimes intolerable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram laughed so that the two tits were frightened and
flew away from their branch. He took Joyce’s hand and put
it to his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We seem to be talking in parables and conundrums.
Joyce, let’s be human. Are you glad I’ve come back to you?
Are we going to wipe the slate clean and start fresh and
fair down the good old highway of married life? Say a
word of love to me! Put your arms around my neck, and
whisper what I want to hear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce’s face flamed with colour for a moment, and then
paled again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t!” she said. “Something’s happened to put things
all wrong—worse than before—between you and me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stared at her, and knew that Fate, or Luck, or God,
was going to hit him another blow between the eyes. What
did she mean? That “Something’s happened—“?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For Christ’s sake,” he said, “what do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s about Kenneth,” she answered in a low voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That name, after what Susan had said, after a night of
dark agony, after a fight with frightful suspicion in which
old base jealousies had surged up from the darkness of his
mind, was like the jab of a bayonet in his brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the hell has he got to do with it?” he asked, very
quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce touched his hand, as though asking for patience
and understanding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll get angry, I know. But I can’t help it. These
things just happen. It’s as though we hadn’t any control
over them, or over ourselves. I’ve always thought of Kenneth
as nothing more than a good friend—a nice boy.
We’ve known each other since we were kids. He understands
me better than any one in the world. We speak in
shorthand, as it were—the same code of thought and all
that. He didn’t seem to mind when I married you. He
thought it was good fun. It made no difference to our
friendship. He’s perfectly straight and clean. He’d no
idea at all, until a few days ago, that he loved me—in
another kind of way. We found out quite suddenly, by
accident. We were laughing—playing the fool, as usual.
We were in a boat together on the lake in the Bois—you
know—by the Île des Châlets. Suddenly he looked up at
me with a kind of surprise in his eyes. And something
seemed to fire a spark between us. I leant over him and
kissed him, and he said, ‘What’s up with us?’—in a frightened
way. We found out then that our old friendship had
changed. For the first time I knew the meaning of love.—Never
like yours and mine, Bertram. Kenneth and I were
made for each other from the time we were babies together.
It’s just that. Unfortunately we’ve only just found out.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I’m frightfully sorry, Bertram. But there it is, and
nothing can alter it now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had spoken all this quietly, in a matter-of-fact way,
but now she began to cry again, with her hands up to her
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram had sat very still, with his head bent during her
monologue. A greyness crept into his face, giving him a
dead look. He was dead for a little while. Joyce had
killed the spirit in him by those words of hers. He had
nothing to say to himself. Not even anger stirred in him,
nor self-pity. All that came into his mind was a kind of
numbness, and one name reiterated. Kenneth! Kenneth!
Kenneth Murless!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joyce took her hands down from her face, and wiped
her tears away with a handkerchief. Then she spoke again
in the same quiet tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kenneth and I want to play the game. He’s fearfully
sorry about you. He likes you immensely and thinks I’ve
given you a rough deal. That’s true. I’ve been beastly to
you, but I didn’t know all the time that it was Kenneth I
wanted. You’ve been jolly good to me, Bertram. I see that
now. But it’s impossible to live together after what I’ve
told you. What are we going to do about it? For the
moment I’ve cut and run. It was Kenneth who asked me
to do that. ‘You’d better cut and run,’ he said. ‘We’ve
got to play the game.’ So here I am waiting until you think
things out. I haven’t told Mother yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram was still silent, still rather dead in his heart and
brain. But one phrase used by Joyce startled him a little.
“I’ve cut and run,” she said. Where had he heard that
before? It was something that had happened to himself.
Some time or other, from some one or other, he too had
“cut and run.” It was old Christy, who had advised it.
“If you’re tempted by disloyalty,” he said, “you’d better
cut and run.” Queer, that Joyce should have been given
the same advice. Rather funny! Damnably funny!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed at the comedy of it. He stood up from the
stone seat and laughed loudly and harshly, frightening the
birds again, a jay in the boughs near by, which flew out
with a kind of echo of his laugh and a quick beat of wings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good God in Heaven!” he said. “So you haven’t told
your Mother yet? I wonder what the Countess of Ottery
will think of it. Her sense of propriety will be a little
shocked. She too will want to play the game according to
the rules. I don’t know this kind of game. Perhaps it’s
up to me. I guess the rules will oblige me to give you an
excuse for divorce. I rather fancy that’s the way it’s done
in your set. I commit a technical sin. I indulge in a perfectly
painless act of cruelty. You institute proceedings
for restitution of conjugal rights. Isn’t that one of the
rules? I refuse on a post-card. Then you divorce me.
The newspapers print your photograph—the beautiful Lady
Joyce Pollard obtains her decree. I seem to remember that
sort of thing.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Joyce! Oh, my dear wife! Joyce, my
beloved!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was quite suddenly, at the end of his monstrous irony,
that he broke down and wept, and pleaded with her weakly,
in a stricken way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several times Joyce said, “I’m sorry, Bertram! I’m
frightfully sorry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She too was weeping now, and her slim body shook with
sobs. Under the trees there in the little glade of a French
château, this man and wife, so English, so young, so good
to see, if love had been between them, made a pitiful picture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve been very good to me, my dear,” said Joyce
again. “I’m sorry—for everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went towards her, and took her roughly and drew her
close to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joyce, this is frightful. It can’t happen. It’s just illusion.
You’re my wife and I’m your lover. Let’s go away
together, and forget all else. That baseness with Kenneth.
It was just a moment of madness. Weakness. I understand!
I’ve been tempted like that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew herself out of his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not like that. It’s Kenneth I belong to; and he
to me. One can’t go against revelation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He told her that she was murdering him. He’d suffered
hell already because of their separation. He’d been tempted
by sheer weakness and loneliness. Did she intend to send
him straight to the devil?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She said something about his going to “a nice woman.”
She couldn’t complain of that. He would find some one
more patient with him, more in tune with his ideas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was that which angered him and broke down any kind
of restraint to which he had clung.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re hellishly immoral,” he told her. “God knows
how far you’ve gone a header with that swine Murless. If
there’s truth in what people say of you in Paris, I’ll wring
your neck and blow his brains out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stiffened at that threat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve told you we intend to play the game as far as possible.
Kenneth has played up like a gentleman. I hope
you won’t behave like a savage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I <span class='it'>am</span> a savage,” he said, “when it comes to this sort of
thing. It is the primitive right of man to make sure of his
mate. D’you think I’m going to connive at your sin? To
play the “<span class='it'>mari complaisant</span>?” Not in your life!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t mediævalise,” said Joyce. “We’re in the Twentieth
Century.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Human nature doesn’t change,” he answered. “You’re
my wife, and I’ll hold you, if I have to fight for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t hold me,” she said. “I’ve escaped. You can
hold my dead body, but not my living heart. Kenneth has
that. From the beginning of things, as I see now, he and
I were meant for each other. You were an accident that
intervened. It was my mistake, and yours. And I’ve paid
for it already, pretty badly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An accident that intervened! That was how she spoke
of his love. That was his position between Joyce Pollard
and Kenneth Murless! The phrase slashed his soul, and
stung him into a mad rage. The man who had come into
this glade with love in his heart for this girl with gold hair
and slim white body, strode towards her now with clenched
fists and a fury in his eyes. He meant to do her bodily
harm, and she saw that in his eyes. But she stood very
straight and still, and did not flinch as he came close to
her, but smiled with a strange disdain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you like,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a kind of invitation to hit her, even to kill her,
if he thought well of that, as for a moment he did. But,
as once before when he had raised his hand against her,
he was disarmed by her prettiness, and the fury passed
from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down the avenue came the sound of voices, speaking
French, and through the trees Bertram saw Yvonne de
Plumoison and her father, as he had seen them walking
arm-in-arm in time of war. On the other side of the old
man was Lady Ottery with her hand on the arm of
Yvonne’s brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram took hold of Joyce, and kissed her twice on the
lips, with passionate brutality, and then released her, flinging
her away from him so that she fell on the grass. He
hadn’t meant, then, to be as rough as that. He made his
way through the glade, and turned a moment to look back.
Joyce was standing again with her face towards him. He
raised his hand with a tragic gesture of farewell, to which
she made no answer. Then he walked back to the great
iron gates through which he passed, and so towards the
village, and so towards life without the hope of Joyce, in
loneliness and desolation of soul, worse than he had known.</p>

<div><h1>XLV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>He left Paris without calling on Kenneth Murless for
the purpose of indulging in violence. What was the
good? To blow Kenneth’s brains out, or to punch his head,
would not bring back Joyce. She had dismissed him for
ever out of her heart and life. He walked alone upon the
road and all that he had felt in loneliness before was nothing
to this certainty of eternal separation. She was dead
to him, and he to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made one last foolish, futile effort to pretend otherwise
by writing her a letter in which he implored her to
wait a while at least before she took the step from which
she could never return.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait six months,” [he said]. “My loyalty is yours for
that time, or longer, and perhaps before the end of it you
will realise your horrible mistake—this midsummer madness
that possesses you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Stuff like that he wrote, but knew the hopelessness of it,
and did not wait in Paris for an answer. She wouldn’t
answer. She had told him all there was to know. As she
had said once before, when as yet the “something” that had
happened had not happened, it was “past argument.” Perhaps—almost
certainly—throughout her married life her
subconsciousness had known what she knew now consciously.
She had been more at ease with Kenneth than
ever with him. She had preferred his conversation, his
sense of humour, his point of view. There was a secret
code between them which he had never learnt. He had been
“out of it,” after the first few weeks of sentiment and
passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He reasoned all this out with astounding calmness of
mind, between bouts of astounding rage and anguish, in the
train from Paris to Berlin. He was quietly and deliberately
rude to a young British officer in his carriage who
tried to enter into conversation on the way to Cologne,
where he belonged to the Army of Occupation. The boy
was surprised by his gruffness, and shrank back into sulky
silence, staring at him now and then with furtive eyes, until
Bertram apologised, and said, “Sorry for being uncivil.
I’ve got the devil of a toothache. You know—a jumping
nerve!” One doesn’t tell a travelling companion that one
has the devil of a broken heart, aching horribly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Lord,” said the boy, “what infernal bad luck! No
wonder you don’t want me to jaw to you! There’s nothing
worse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He offered Bertram a brandy flask and said “it helped
sometimes.” And Bertram, to satisfy him, took a good
swig which at least had the effect of sending him to sleep
after a wakeful night. It was an uneasy sleep, and he
wakened once crying out the name of Joyce. Fortunately
the young officer was dozing, or pretending to doze. He
left the carriage at Cologne, and hoped Bertram’s toothache
would be cured by the time he reached Berlin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A nice boy, like thousands who had been as young as he
at the beginning of the war, and now had been four years,
six years, even seven years, dead. How extraordinary was
that! Bertram had been barely nineteen when he first
joined up, in 1914. Now he was getting on for twenty-six,
and felt as old as fifty. Well, he’d crammed in all the experience
of life—war, marriage, failure, complete and absolute
tragedy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What was life? Nothing but some kind of service, where
he could be of use somewhere. Service to boys younger
than himself, like that kid on the way to Cologne. He
might help, by a hairsbreadth in the balance of fate, to save
their lives from another massacre. That would be worth
doing. He was dedicated still to his work for peace. But
first he must get peace within himself. Not easy, with this
conflict tearing inside him. He must get some kind of wisdom,
serenity, quietude of resignation before he could work
for peace in the world. He would “chuck” thinking about
his own wound, and plunge into the study of the world after
war. That was the only line of sanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Berlin ought to be interesting. He would meet his sister
Dorothy there, with her German husband. He would get
to hear things and see things. It would be strange to walk
about among the Enemy, without being killed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not long ago the Germans were “They.” During the
war that was always the word used. “They” are putting
up a strafe along the Menin Road. “They” are very quiet
to-day. “They” are rather active on the Divisional Front.
It would be damn funny to meet them in shops and restaurants,
perhaps in private drawing-rooms—men, very
likely, who had potted at him when he’d shown his cap a
second above the parapet, or fired the five-point-nines which
had rattled his nerves in a rat-haunted dug-out.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram could not get a room in any hotel in Berlin.
There was a waiters’ strike, and all the hotels were closed
and picketed except the Adlon, which paid what the
strikers demanded, clapped the difference on to the bills,
and did a roaring business with every room booked weeks
in advance, and crowds of Germans, Austrians, English, and
Jews of all nationalities, clamouring for admittance at any
price, and bribing the head clerk with thousands of marks,
to get their names on the waiting list.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the outside porter of the Adlon who saved Bertram
from a night in the streets, by giving him a card to a
private lodging-house somewhere near the Grossspielhaus,
where he was able to obtain a bed-sitting-room in which all
his meals would be served.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His landlord came in repeatedly to study his comfort, to
explain the working of the electric light, to ask whether he
desired <span class='it'>helles</span> or <span class='it'>dunkles</span> beer, and to carry in his tray
with the <span class='it'>Abend-essen</span>. He was a tall Prussian of middle-age
who had been a <span class='it'>Feldwebel</span>, or sergeant-major, with
the Second Prussian Guards, after keeping a small hotel in
Manchester. He spoke very good English, and lingered to
talk while Bertram ate a well-cooked steak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were an officer in the English army?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram nodded. “In France, all the time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I also. We were opposite the English at Ypres, Cambrai,
the Somme, in ’16. I used to hear your men talking
in the trenches. Sometimes I called out to them, and sometimes
they answered back. ‘How deep are you in mud,
Tommy?’ That was in the winter of ’16. ‘Up to our
bloody knees,’ said an English Tommy. ‘That’s nothing,’
I answered, ‘We’re up to our waists.’ ‘Serve you bloody
well right!’ said the English boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He chuckled over the reminiscence, but presently sighed
deeply and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The war was one long horror.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What made you begin it?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a war of Capital. We were all silly sheep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram went on eating, and wished the man would go.
He wanted to be alone. But the man stood by his chair and
was anxious to talk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose they still hate us in England?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re not fond of you,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man sighed again, noisily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was very happy in Manchester.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You will find no
hate against the English in Germany. Not much. We
know you believe in ‘fair play.’ Not like the French!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t like the French?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man’s face suddenly deepened in colour, and there
came into his eyes a look of rage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The French? They’ve put every insult on us. Make
us eat dirt. One day we’ll go back, and wring their necks—like
this!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put his big hands together, and gave them a convulsive
twist while he made a noise in his throat like a man
choking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you’d had enough of war,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not against the French. I’d march again to-morrow to
make them feel the German boot in their backsides.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it would happen all over again,” said Bertram.
“The lousy trenches, the gun-fire, the massacre of
men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With a difference,” said the man, in a low voice, as
though hiding, or half-revealing a secret thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What kind of difference?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The French won’t have the English on their side next
time. <span class='it'>Nicht wahr?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram swung round in his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the Germans think that, they’re making the hell of a
mistake. For the second time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>So?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man had a scared look, as though he had said too
much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your dinner was good. It was good meat, <span class='it'>nicht wahr</span>?
Better than in the trenches!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed in a guttural way, desiring to wipe out a
bad impression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night Bertram set out to find his sister Dorothy,
the Frau von Arenburg. By a queer coincidence in names,
she lived in the Dorotheenstrasse, somewhere across the
Wilhelmstrasse, at the corner of which was the British Embassy.
Unfamiliar with the geography of Berlin, he lost
his way, and found himself in the Leipzigerstrasse, so that,
in halting German, he had to ask for the direction from
a passer-by. It was a tall young man who listened very
patiently to his bad German and then spoke in excellent
English.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you will follow me, sir, I shall be very happy to guide
you to the address.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very good of you,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A pleasure, believe me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the way he fell into step it was easy to see the man
had been a soldier, and by all his bearing, an officer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a stranger in Berlin, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My first visit,” said Bertram. “I arrived to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>So?</span> You will find people friendly to you as an Englishman.
We admire your sporting instincts, if I may say so
without offence. You have chivalry to your enemy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope so,” said Bertram, coldly, thinking of the propaganda
of hate in some part of the English press, yet resenting
a little this praise of England from a German officer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the war your men bore no grudge after the fight.
I was a prisoner after Cambrai, in ’17. Your ‘Tommies’
gave me cigarettes when I was captured, and I was generously
treated. I am pleased to acknowledge that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our prisoners were not well-treated in Germany,” said
Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps that was so, here and there,” said the officer.
“We hadn’t much food to spare. We were all on half-rations
towards the end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was great brutality in some of the camps,” said
Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doubtless some of our prison commandants were brutal.
We have not yet reached the stage of the English in good
humour. I admit that, in spite of our <span class='it'>Kultur</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed frankly, and then halted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are now in Dorotheenstrasse, at Number 20. Good-night
and good luck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saluted ceremoniously, but Bertram held out his hand
and thanked him. The action seemed to touch the young
man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s kind of you—to shake hands! We don’t like the
English to think of us as Huns. We are not so bad as
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A war name!” said Bertram. “Now it’s peace between
us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peace and good will,” said the young man. “We cannot
say that of all our late enemies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hesitated for a moment, as though wishing the excuse
of talking further. But as Bertram was silent, he saluted
again, swung on his heel, and strode down the street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After all it was a vain walk to Dorotheenstrasse, because
when Bertram rang the bell of his sister’s house, the
<span class='it'>Mädchen</span> who answered the door gave him to understand
that the Herr Baron von Arenburg and the <span class='it'>gnädige Frau</span>
were away in the country, and would not return until the
following afternoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a disappointment. Bertram felt like all men alone
in a strange city, very lonely in its crowds. And his loneliness
was deepened by a sense of spiritual desolation, and
personal abandonment, because of Joyce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was surely, he thought, one of the loneliest men in
the whole world that night, and then fought against the
self-pity which threatened again to overwhelm him. “Keep
a stiff upper lip, my lad!” he said to himself as he wandered
about the well-lighted streets with these Germans on
every side of him, seeking amusement in the “<span class='it'>Wein-stube</span>”
and dancing halls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They seemed happy. There was no visible sign of penury
here, or of unhealed wounds of war, as in London where
unemployed men went begging of the theatre crowds and
there was a general air of depression and anxiety of many
faces. These people were alert, cheerful, apparently prosperous.
The only reminder of the agony they must have
suffered was a blind man in soldier’s uniform who sat selling
matches with a drooping head and pale, sad face. Now
and then the passers-by dropped a coin in his tray and he
said “<span class='it'>Danke schön!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram pushed through a swing door into a place where
music was being played. He couldn’t wander about all the
time. It was partly a drinking-place, and partly a dancing-hall.
The open space for dancing was surrounded by little
tables all crowded with men and women drinking wine out
of long-necked bottles. In the gallery an orchestra was
playing jazz tunes, with a terrible blare of instruments.
Every now and then men and women rose from the tables
and joined the dancers until they were all densely wedged
in one moving mass, jazzing up and down gracelessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram took a seat at a vacant table, and ordered some
wine to pay for his place. He sat there, staring at the
dancers and the people at the tables. Some of the girls
were astonishingly pretty in the German type, with blonde
hair and blue eyes. There was one who reminded him of
Joyce, and he felt a sharp touch of pain at the thought.
She had the same kind of gold-spun hair and slim figure,
but her face was painted, which was not a habit of Joyce’s,
and it was plain to see that she was a girl of “easy virtue”
by the way her eyes roved around the group of men, with
inviting smiles. She sat alone, smoking a cigarette, with
her elbows on the table. The men were mostly of a repulsive
type. There were several of them with shaven heads,
or so closely cropped that they were nearly bald, as he had
seen Prussian officers when, as prisoners, they had thrown
away their shrapnel helmets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other men here were foreigners, a few English, a group
of Americans, a number of Jews of unguessable nationalities.
The women mingled with them, drank with them,
ogled them, and they did not resent these German <span class='it'>houris</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram had never seen such dancing. It was perfectly
respectable, but grotesque because of the stiff way in which
the Germans interpreted the modern steps with a kind of
mechanical jig.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl like Joyce—horribly like her—came round to
Bertram’s table and sat deliberately in front of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“English boy?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“English,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do not drink your wine. Shall I help you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She poured herself out a glass of Niersteiner, and touched
Bertram’s glass and said “Prosit!” before taking a sip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why are you sad?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it a gay world?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shrugged her bare shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the English it should be good. They won the war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not so sure,” said Bertram. “Berlin seems full of
rich people, all drinking and dancing like this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl looked round on the company, and made a
grimace of disgust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Foreigners mostly in these places. Jews. Profiteers,”—she
said the word <span class='it'>Schieber</span> for the last class. “This isn’t
Germany. It’s the same hell as in other great cities of the
world, London, Paris, New York.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know London?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well. I was there as a dancer before the war.
At the Empire. How’s dear old Piccadilly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still there,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wished to God this girl would go away. The line
of her neck as she turned her head reminded him of Joyce
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to get back to London,” she said. “Here one
must be wicked or starve to death. I have a sister who’s
good. She’s a dressmaker. She earns sixty marks a day,
sewing on buttons and hooks. It costs her more than
that to buy a chemise. She goes to bed when she gets her
underclothes washed, once a month. Now she had tuberculosis
from <span class='it'>unternährung</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What you call under-feeding. Starvation is another
name for it. All the good people suffer from <span class='it'>unternährung</span>.
My mother died from it in the war, when none of us had
enough to eat, whatever our virtue. You English made us
suffer like that. Your blockade.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was rather cruel, don’t you think? After the war
you kept the blockade up until Peace was signed. You
made war against our babies and killed thousands, so that
we should be starved into surrender. That wasn’t what you
call playing the game.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The war game,” said Bertram. “You would have been
harder with us if you had won.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s true. War is perhaps as cruel as peace. Most
men are devils, and women she-devils.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some of them are pretty decent,” said Bertram. “If
they get a chance. The ordinary crowd.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not cruel,” she answered. “You are kind. You
have kind eyes, and you talk to me as though I were a good
woman. I would love you very much if you would let
me. What do you say, English boy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must be going,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She made a protest, holding his arm, but he called
“<span class='it'>Ober!</span>” and paid for the wine, and rose from his chair.
She held out her hand, and he gave her his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect you’re too good to live,” she said, with a queer
little laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ought to have died before,” he said, “but I missed the
luck. In the war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Learn to laugh,” she said. “Laugh at the cruelty of
life, like I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect you know its cruelty,” he said, with a little
pity in his voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Down to the bottom of hell,” she answered, and laughed
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, good-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Gute Nacht, hübschen!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bent down suddenly and kissed his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went out of the dancing hall strangely perturbed.
As the girl had bent her head to kiss his hand, the glint of
her hair was a terrible reminder of Joyce. Yet this girl
who was “bad” had been kinder to him than Joyce! That
was a frightful thought. And Joyce was bad too, in a different
way. She’d transferred herself to Kenneth with less
temptation than this German girl who sold her love to
escape <span class='it'>unternährung</span>, which was starvation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His passing out of the hall was blocked by a group of
people at the entrance. Something was going to happen,
and Bertram was forced to stay and see it. Nothing worth
seeing, except as a study of human anatomy in acrobatic
eccentricity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A girl made her way through the little crowd to where
a man dressed as a sailor waited for her. She wore a red
cloak, but dropped it on the edge of the dirty floor, and
took the sailor’s hand. For five minutes he whirled her
about like a rag doll, flung her over his head, held her wrist
and swung her from him, round and round, with frightful
rapidity, hurled her backwards, and caught her before her
head was smashed against the polished boards—a kind of
Apache dance intensified in brutality. Several times the girl
came down on her toes from a flying spin and smiled and
kissed her hands to the groups of wine-drinkers who applauded
and clinked their glasses together as a sign of approval.
At the end the girl came to the edge of the dancing
floor, picked up her red cloak, thrust her way through the
group at the entrance, who said “<span class='it'>Schön! Schön!</span>” and then
collapsed on to a wooden chair half concealed by a curtain
in the passage. Bertram saw her face, which was dead
white. She was sitting back with her neck over the rail of
the chair, gasping like a dying creature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram spoke to a man in a kind of uniform like a
commissionaire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she all right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She will recover. She goes to another hall presently.
She does that five times a night, and is well known in
Berlin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much does she get for that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man laughed in his throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enough to keep her alive. About as much as the price
of a bottle of wine. Women are cheap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram thought of some words spoken by the German
girl who had kissed his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“War is almost as cruel as peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Terrible words, spoken with tragic sincerity and a painted
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It wasn’t true. He had seen the cruelty of war, not only
in the fighting line and in the fields of the dead, and the
wounded, the blinded and gassed, but in villages where
women saw their little homes go up in flames, fled from the
approach of the Enemy, wept for those who had been
caught before escape was possible, led the life of refugees
through years of misery and squalor and hopelessness.
War was not an alternative cruelly to that of peace. It
was an additional cruelty. It didn’t stop the private vices
and cruelties of men and women. It created more vice,
more disease, more starvation, more of that hell into which
the girl like Joyce had fallen.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But peace, after all, was
cruel! And life, anyhow, at its worst and at its best. All
one could do, it seemed, was to acquire a little courage, a
sense of humour, a touch of charity, and make the best of
a bad business, or with luck, which wasn’t his, a little private
paradise.</p>

<div><h1>XLVI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>He found his sister Dorothy at home next evening,
waiting for him excitedly, having had the message he
had left with the <span class='it'>Mädchen</span>. He was surprised by her emotion
at seeing him, not having realised what this would
mean to a girl who had been exiled in the enemy’s country
through the war, and had seen no one of her kith and kin
till now, three years after the ending of war. She took
hold of him, laughing and crying at the same time, held him
at arm’s length to see the change in him, drew him close
again, and kissed him with rather overwhelming joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had changed more than he had imagined. Two years
older than himself—she was twenty-eight now—her coiled
brown hair was already touched with grey, and her beautiful
face—she had always been the beauty of the family—bore
visible traces of some past anguish. In an indefinable
way also, she had become German. There was something
of the “<span class='it'>Haus-Frau</span>” about her, not only in her style of
dress but in her look and her way of moving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She told him she had a million questions she wanted to
ask, and first of all of her father, and of her dear mother
and of poor Digby and Susan, and then of himself and
Joyce, whom she had never seen—“funny that, Bertram!”—and
then of England, and Ireland. Poor, tragic, rebellious
Ireland!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A big order!” said Bertram. “It would take a month
to tell you all that, and most of it is tragedy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall tell me for a month. I want to hear everything,
through the war and afterwards. Once I was
starved for food—we lived on next to nothing in the two
last years of war!—but now I am more starved for news.
I ache for every detail of it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But intimate talk was checked awhile on Bertram’s side
by the appearance of Dorothy’s husband, the Baron von
Arenburg. He was a soldierly-looking fellow of about
thirty, with easy manners, and a fair, good-natured face,
with grey eyes and a little yellow moustache. He shook
hands with a firm grip, and said he was delighted to meet
Dorothy’s brother, “whom she adores!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram knew something of his record during the war,
through Dorothy’s letters to her mother. He had been with
the cavalry in East Prussia, in the great sweep back under
Mackensen. Most of the time he had been on the Russian
Front, and was only in the West in the last phase of the
war, when the dismounted cavalry were thrown in to
stiffen the retreat in September of ’18, to the end. “War
prolongers!” as the German infantry called them, derisively
and with hate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram noticed that he kissed his wife’s hand on entering,
with a kind of gallant reverence, surprising, he thought,
in a German, though afterwards he saw it was the usual
custom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At dinner the conversation was desultory. Bertram
hedged on most of the subjects which might lead him into
deep water. To enquiries about Joyce he answered vaguely
that she was staying with some friends in France. To
Dorothy’s questions about the purpose of his visit to Germany
he answered that he was “writing a bit”—in a journalistic
way. He wanted to study the conditions in Germany,
the spirit of the people, and so on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy and her husband exchanged glances. This
seemed to them exciting news. They were glad, they said,
that at last some one had come from England to tell the
truth about Germany. The English newspapers told nothing
but lies. The falsity of the picture they drew was positively
frightful—“utterly grotesque,” said Von Arenburg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In what way?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy told him “in every way.” They pretended that
Germany was getting enormously rich, that the people were
not taxed, that the German mark was being forced down
deliberately, in exchange value, in order to capture the
world’s trade, that Germany was making munitions of war
and training secret armies, that the Revolution was a sham,
and the plea of poverty a colossal fraud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is none of that true?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy laughed, the old, full-throated laugh which he
remembered in the old days of home life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lies, lies, lies!” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emotionally, vehemently, she protested that the middle
classes in Germany were so impoverished by the downfall
of the mark that even now they were on “short commons”
and unable to buy clothes, especially underclothes or boots.
So far from escaping taxation, they were ground down with
taxes—even small incomes equal to sixty pounds a year in
England. The mark fell because every time Germany had
to pay her monstrous indemnities she had to purchase
foreign money at gold rates, and then print enormous new
issues of paper money.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole thing was mad. Germany, after four and a
half years of war which had ruined her utterly, was expected
to pay back the losses of all her enemies, and all
their war-pensions, and all the cost of the Army of Occupation.
Not even the United States, which had all the gold
in the world, could pay such fabulous sums.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s only fair that Germany should pay for the ruin she
made,” said Bertram stolidly. “I was in France during
the war. I saw the destruction of her cities and villages
and farms and harvest fields. Wiped off the map.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re ready to help France to reconstruct all that,” said
Dorothy, and Bertram winced a little at that “we.” He
shrank from this sister of his identifying herself with her
husband’s people. “What we cannot do is to pay for pensions
and all the other ridiculous charges.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Germany is bound to go bankrupt,” said Von Arenburg.
“Nothing can prevent that, and when it happens, Europe
will be dragged down with us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“France wants to push Germany into the mud,” said
Dorothy. “Nothing will satisfy her but a march into the
Ruhr to seize the industrial cities and strangle Germany’s
chance of life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall try to escape—by way of Russia,” said Von
Arenburg. “It will cause another war within a generation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then the breakdown of civilisation in Europe,” said
Dorothy. “Dear God! I can’t believe that England will
allow it. England’s generous, in spite of her cruelty at
times.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cruelty?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The blockade,” she said. “It was cruel to starve German
babies—after the Armistice—to force the Treaty of
Versailles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some one else had said that. It was the girl like Joyce
in the dancing hall—the little prostitute— It seemed to
be a general belief. Was there any truth in it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For her own interests, England must prevent it!” said
Von Arenburg. “She needs world-markets for her goods.
She must work for the recovery of Europe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even if France insists on her right to Shylock’s pound
of flesh,” said Dorothy. “France is the enemy of the
world’s peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram’s face flushed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to argue,” he said, “but I know the sacrifice
of France. I saw her agony with my own eyes. I’ve
just been in the old battlefields again, among the peasants
there. There’s only one thing that’s in all their minds—a
dread of another war. They’re still not sure that one day
Germany won’t come back again, and re-light the red fires.
They want nothing but security, and they don’t see it, except
in keeping Germany weak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re going the wrong way to work to prevent another
war,” said Dorothy. “There’s not an insult, a petty
provocation, a threat of ignominy, that they haven’t heaped
on Germany since the signing of Peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One must understand their point of view,” said Bertram.
“Germany wasn’t very tender of French feelings in
time of war, when she thought she was winning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He changed the topic of conversation. His advocacy of
France seemed to distress Dorothy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After dinner, when with a tactful word or two Von Arenburg
left his wife alone with her brother, Dorothy revealed
her thoughts more deeply, with an emotion which touched
him, because he shared her hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not that I hate France,” she said. “I used to weep
for France when German armies were trampling through
her fields—during the years of death. But I hate war. Oh,
Bertram, you’ve seen it, and can hardly tell what you’ve
seen, because no words can tell it all, but I’ve suffered perhaps
more than you. Imagine an English wife of a German
husband through all these years! You can’t imagine.
The torture of a dual allegiance—duty to my husband, pity
for the German wounded—for their frightful slaughter—for
the spiritual despair of the German people knowing,
in spite of early victories, that they were doomed—for they
knew it always! Then, on the other side, my love for England,
my pride in English courage, my dreams at night
because of English armies under German gunfire, with you,
my dear, among them, somewhere in those dreadful fields.
I’m angry with France now because she seems to prevent
the spirit of peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s not sure that Germany won’t seek revenge again.
Are <span class='it'>you</span> sure?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy sighed, and seemed to think deeply of all that
she knew about the German people. Then she told her
brother that before the Armistice, and afterwards, the German
people had revolted against the war, and militarism.
They were all “Wilsonites.” If in defeat they’d been
treated generously, they would have risen with immense,
overwhelming emotion to new ideals of world peace. But
the Treaty of Versailles seemed to put them in chains and
doom them to an eternal servitude of debt to the victor
nations. Then the attitude of France had been so harsh
and so provocative that gradually the German people had
hardened again in spirit, and the old venom had come back.
The ideals of world peace were abandoned by French
policy which sought only the ringing round of Germany
with hostile states to keep her down under the menace of
armed force. Now hatred for France smouldered in every
German heart, and the future was black.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid!” she said, “I’m afraid!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were the words which Christy had once spoken in
his rooms in London, on a journey back from Central
Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes filled with tears, and then she brushed them
away and smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s forget all that to-night. Tell me about my dear
ones, living and dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For hours they talked of their mother and father, Susan
and Digby, their old home life, and old friends; and it
seemed as though the War had stricken every one, and
utterly changed the world they had known when they had
lived together under the same roof. It seemed as though
they were survivors from a great earthquake. Then Bertram
told Dorothy of his own tragedy with Joyce, and she
cried out with grief that English womanhood should so
forget its old code of virtue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something seems to have changed in the soul of England!”
she said. “What is it, Bertram? Have they all
broken under the strain of war?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It smashed the old traditions,” he said. “Some of them
wanted smashing, but the process is painful—and some of
the best things got broken with the worst.”</p>

<div><h1>XLVII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>In the company of his sister and her husband, Bertram
saw a good deal of the inner life of Germany, and polished
up his knowledge of the language sufficiently to carry
on conversation with the people he met.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was much that he came to admire in German character,
and there were times when he reproached himself for
having forgotten “the Enemy” so completely that he could
shake hands with a German (so violating an ancient vow)
without any sense of physical repugnance, and even discuss
the war in a friendly way with men, like Von Arenburg,
who had been responsible for the death of British soldiers,
and among them his own best comrades.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He used to wonder sometimes whether that were not
treachery to his old standards of loyalty and honour, and
was conscience-stricken because he accepted hospitality, kindness,
even friendship, from these people. But he found it
impossible to keep up the old “hate” against them. Even
in war-time that spirit of hate had been behind the lines
rather than in the trenches. The “Tommies” had given
cigarettes to their prisoners after the heat of battle. German
officers had been treated civilly by British officers, if
they were at all well-behaved, and within a few days after
the occupation of Cologne, British soldiers had clinked beer
mugs with the fellows who had once lain behind machine
guns, mowing them down. That was the real spirit of
chivalry, a lesson taught by the common man, obeying some
instinctive decent law of nature, to neurotic and morbid-minded
people who watered the roots of hate and cultivated
its poisonous fruit with unceasing care.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only by some friendly pact with these people could Europe
have peace. Bertram could see no chance of peace if
they were to be treated for ever as moral lepers. It was
ridiculous to regard them as moral lepers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How could he take that view when he moved among their
crowds in the Opera House, in pleasant beer gardens outside
Berlin to which they flocked in the evenings, by the
lakeside and in the woods of the Grünewald? These young
Germans with their girls, drinking light beer, eating ices,
chattering to the music of the band, playing with little
flaxen-haired children, did not behave like moral lepers.
They were good-natured, decent, smiling folk, the girls wonderfully
neat and pretty and plump, in cheap frocks, the
men shabbily dressed, many in their old war tunics dyed
and re-cut to civilian styles, but scrupulously brushed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Von Arenburg, who had a certain sense of humour, limited
by a Prussian outlook, used to ask Bertram what he
thought of the “Huns” in assemblies like that. “Do they
behave like barbarians? Do you see them eating their
babies?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Bertram; “but I find them enjoying themselves,
obviously well-fed, not badly dressed, and spending
quite a lot of marks on their evening’s amusement. What
about this German poverty, that you keep telling me about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Dorothy who tried to explain. These people in
their home lives stinted and scraped to enjoy an evening’s
pleasure like this. They lived in overcrowded rooms,
stiflingly hot in summer. To go to a beer garden in the
evening was essential for very life and health. It cost but
a few marks for light beer or a pink ice. Look at the girls’
frocks, so clean, but so cheap. Look at their boots, made
of paper and sham leather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram was not satisfied with these explanations. It
seemed to him in Berlin and the other towns to which he
went, that the German people were marvellously prosperous
after the war. It was true that in exchange value German
paper money was slumping away at an alarming rate, and
that every time it dropped prices were higher in the shops.
But wages seemed to rise also, and people seemed to get
more paper money every month, which, in Germany, had
still a fair purchasing power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wandered round the great stores, like Wertheim’s,
and was startled by the amazingly low price of everything
manufactured in Germany, and there seemed nothing they
didn’t make. Translated into English figures, at the current
rate of exchange, they were a mockery of English
competition. At such prices they could beat us in every
market of the world, and, so it seemed, were doing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Von Arenburg pooh-poohed his argument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all illusion,” he said. “I admit the feverish activity
of German trade and industry. It’s the genius of our
people, inspired by a desperate desire to avert their ruin.
But nothing can do that so long as the Allied nations do
not release their stranglehold. We sell below cost price.
To buy raw material from abroad we have to pay the difference
on the mark. We’re bleeding to death. Presently
the crash will come, and Europe will shudder in all its
members.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram was not good at arithmetic. International
finance was a mystery to him. He could not find any clue
to this economic mystery of the German people, bankrupt
(they said) yet prosperous, capturing world trade (as they
admitted), yet “bleeding to death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>More within his power of observation was the mentality
of these people, and in patient listening at luncheon tables
and dinner tables, where he met the Junker crowd and the
“Intellectuals,” in conversations with shop-keepers and
peasants, he tried to discover the drift of thought in Germany
after defeat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Largely the peace of the world depended upon their outlook
on the future. Had they liberated themselves from
their old militarism? Were they preparing to march forward
as a free democracy in a commonwealth of nations,
away from the darkness of the old War-Gods in this
Jungle? Or were they again worshipping those ancient
gods with secret rites and propitiations?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was hard to tell among Dorothy’s friends. They revealed
how deep the agony of war had been in their souls,
how sharply the wound still hurt. These German ladies,
very charming, some of them, had lost fathers, husbands,
brothers, lovers, sons, even in more appalling numbers
than the death-rate of England. Whole families of the
German aristocracy had been wiped out, and in the humbler
classes it was the same.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They cursed the war, and the Army commanders, and
the politicians. They said they had been “betrayed” by the
conceit of Ludendorff, by the folly of the Supreme War
Council, by the spirit of Bolshevism among the troops on
the Russian Front who had been bitten by that frightful
microbe. They protested against the “cruelty” of the Versailles
Treaty, and asserted their faith in Wilson’s “Fourteen
Points” which had never been fulfilled. That was
another betrayal, not only of Germany, but of all the hopes
of the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet never once in any company did any German, man or
woman, acknowledge the guilt of Germany in having
started the war. Russia had “moved first.” England had
hemmed in Germany. The German people had been ringed
round by enemies. And in spite of all those enemies, the
German armies had never been defeated. It was the home
front that had broken down, by sheer starvation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never defeated! Bertram challenged that belief, with
some violence, at one of Dorothy’s afternoon “at homes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the ladies were several ex-officers, two Generals
of Rupprecht’s Army, so long opposite the British, in
Flanders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was General von Althof who made the statement, with
simple sincerity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Gott sei dank!</span> Our brave Armies were never defeated,
from first to last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That surprises me,” said Bertram, with an ironical
smile; “I always thought the German Armies were broken
to bits. First on the Marne, in July ’18. Afterwards like
brown paper on August 8th. They could never hold a line
again. When the end came they’d lost hundreds of thousands
of prisoners, thousands of guns, and the whole war-machine
was destroyed. Otherwise there was no need to
sign the Armistice, the greatest surrender of any nation
in the history of the world, surely?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not a courteous way of speech; not kind. But
Bertram was becoming rather tired of this calm forgetfulness
of what had happened in history, and he disliked the
type represented by General von Althof, one of those hard,
bald-headed Prussians, with a mind as narrow as a Brazil
nut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Von Althof became red about the gills, and then very
pale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doubtless, as a young regimental officer, you regard
local successes as great victories. That is a common error,
not difficult to understand. As a General of the German
High Command, I repeat, sir, that our glorious Armies
were never defeated in the field of battle. The Armistice
was forced upon us by revolution at home, and the broken
<span class='it'>morale</span> of a hungry people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There can be no argument about it,” said one of the
younger officers. “It is an accepted fact.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram made a considerable argument about it, until
checked by Dorothy, who was visibly distressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General von Althof departed with suppressed rage, after
a stiff bow to Bertram, and the other officers took their
leave later, so that only a few ladies remained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of them was the Fräulein von Wegener, a pretty
blonde, who seemed to be Dorothy’s greatest friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She crossed over to Bertram, sitting by his side, and her
eyes were alight with amusement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I don’t think our Armies were defeated—I’m
German!—but I adore the courage with which you attacked
Von Althof. It made me tremble all over! I have
never seen any officer disagree with a General. It isn’t done
in Germany. You reminded me of St. George and the
Dragon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram’s rage had subsided, and he felt guilty of a social
misdemeanour in having raised such an argument in Dorothy’s
drawing-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I behaved like the Dragon,” he said. “Breathing out
fire. A disgraceful incident!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love sincerity,” said Fräulein von Wegener. “And I
hate Generals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’s that?” asked Bertram. “They seem to be highly
respected in Germany, in spite of their—well, let’s call it
failure to achieve absolute victory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl laughed, with a pleasant, musical, mirthful
sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Their self-conceit is <span class='it'>kolossal</span>! But they’ve been found
out. The German people have no more use for them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think that?” asked Bertram, doubtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The people,” she said, and then lowered her voice.
“Not the little crowd in drawing-rooms like this.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I go
among the working folk, in children’s clinics—for charity,
you know. They hate war and all its stupidity. Never
again, they say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not even against France?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hesitated, and seemed embarrassed for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not even against France, if she gives us a decent
chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spoke of Dorothy, looking across at her with admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your lovely sister has made me a Pacifist. She’s a
saint. She has converted me from all my wicked ways.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were very wicked?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In idea,” she said, smiling. “Full of naughty passion,
and intolerance, and rebellion against God. Now I’m getting
good. I have a new philosophy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Love of humanity,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It sounds good,” said Bertram. “But I seem to have
heard of it before, and it’s a little vague.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came to know more of her philosophy, even more of
her love of humanity, because Dorothy invited her often to
the house, and to the Opera, where she was placed next to
Bertram, and to picnic parties in the Grünewald, where she
looked her prettiest in muslin frocks “made by my own
little fingers” (she told him), and to evening concerts in
public gardens outside Berlin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anna was her name, and because of her close friendship
with Dorothy—they were almost like sisters, it seemed—she
insisted upon Bertram calling her that and forgetting
the <span class='it'>gnädiges Fräulein</span>. She called him Bertram, after
demurely asking his permission. He found her amusing.
She had a playful sense of humour and teased him because
of his English shyness. For England, in spite of being
German, she had a romantic admiration, and she confessed
to him that the manners of Englishmen seemed to be adorable,
because of their courtesy to women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My manners are atrocious,” said Bertram, “as you may
have observed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not agree. She thought he had the look of a
Lancelot in Tennyson’s “Idylls of the King,” which she read
with exquisite delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was impossible for Bertram to ignore the fact that
she flirted with him ardently, and that her eyes worshipped
him. He was not annoyed. He liked it. He liked
the little curl that played about each cheek, and her
milky skin, and her laughing voice, and pretty, plump
figure. She was what Christy used to call, in his dry way,
“a cuddlesome thing—and highly dangerous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram did not find her extremely dangerous, though
he acknowledged to himself that a little care might be
necessary at times, if he wished to avoid temptation. There
was no need why he should avoid temptation, being a free
man, now that Joyce had flung him over, but always there
was that trick of conscience in him, or self-imposed repression,
which had held him back from easy amour, which
meant no more to other men he knew than a passing adventure,
without consequence. In any case, this girl was
of high caste. A love affair would mean marriage, and
he was not as free as that, nor so inclined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a moment of danger one evening in the Grünewald,
that wonderful woodland within a tram journey of
Berlin. Dorothy and her husband had wandered away,
hand in hand, like two lovers of the humbler class who
came here also for their picnics and pleasure parties. Anna
and Bertram sat together in a little bower, hidden from
the passers-by, where they had all had tea together an hour
or more ago. Birds were singing in the boughs above
their heads, and Bertram sat with his back to a tree, listening
to the pleasant twitter and watching the light play
through the leaves. Anna sat on the grass, a yard away
from him, with her muslin frock spread out and her straw
hat by her side. The breeze played softly with the little
curl on each cheek, and she was like the princess in a German
fairy-tale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bertram,” she said presently, “you are very silent.
Talk to me, and tell me pretty things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silence is good,” he said. “I like looking at your prettiness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>So?</span> Now that is what I like to hear you say!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve said it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say it again. Do you think me pretty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wonderfully beautiful!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not that. That’s insincere. Dorothy is beautiful.
I’m only a <span class='it'>hübsches mädel</span>—a pretty maid. Do you like
me, Bertram?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t hate me because I’m German?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve finished with hate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you love me a little?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed at her audacity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean by love?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can only tell by what I feel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’s that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel that I want to be with you always, and to go
where you go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was on her knees now, and moved a little way towards
him, and dropped down on the grass with her elbows
up, and her dimpled chin in the cup of her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram was startled. This was going a little too far,
perhaps. It had reached the danger point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid if you went where I am going it would be
to unpleasant places. I’m off to Moscow next week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Moscow! And next week! Let me come with you,
then. With you I should feel safe, even in Moscow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The idea amused him. It would be pleasant enough to
have Anna as his travelling companion. It would be a
cure for loneliness. But it was out of the bounds of possibility,
and not within his code of honour, or mental
liberty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My passport is only for one,” he said. “And it has
taken me a month to get.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait another month and get two!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Nicht möglich!</span> Let’s join Dorothy and her husband.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cold Englishman!” she said, and sprang up with a
vexed laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not cold,” he said, taking her hand. “Only prudent.
Or cowardly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They walked away, through the wood, hand in hand, as
Dorothy and Von Arenburg had gone before them. Anna
held his hand tight, and presently looked up at him with
coaxing eyes and a childish pout.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’re going so soon, we may as well begin to say
good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The meaning of her words was plain. She wanted him
to kiss her, and under a tree there the place was good and
discreet. He rather liked the idea of kissing her, but for
a little warning that it could not end there, if he began.
She called him “cold Englishman.” He was not that. He
was too easily fired, and knew that if he once let a spark
touch his passion, it might blaze into something like a
bonfire. He didn’t want to make a blaze with this little
German girl. So he compromised—the middle of the road
again!—and raised her hand to his lips, very gallantly,
but without ardour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pooh!” she said, and taking her hand away, put it
round his neck and pulled his head down and kissed him,
and then with a laugh ran from him towards Dorothy and
her husband, who appeared down one of the glades.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was on the way home that evening that he told Dorothy
of a telegram he had received that morning from
Bernard Hall of <span class='it'>The New World</span>. His passport had been
arranged with the Soviet authorities. Christy was waiting
for him to go down the Volga in the famine region. Bernard
Hall wanted the truth about the famine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy received the news as a tragic blow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t bear you to go away!” she cried. “Stay here,
Bertram. Give up the visit to Russia. It’s more dangerous
than ever. Stay with us in Germany, and make your home
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My home?” he said, with a sudden pang of self-pity,
“I have no home, now Joyce has left me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy answered him in a low, emotional voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are good women in Germany. One of them loves
you already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meaning Anna von Wegener?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have guessed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was astonished at the rapidity of his intuition, and
surprised, and rather hurt, when he laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wasn’t a difficult guess. She doesn’t let concealment
‘like a worm i’ the bud, feed on her damask cheek.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he spoke seriously to this sister who had always
been his comrade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m still haunted by the thought of Joyce. I pretend
I’ve done with her, cut her image out of my heart and
soul. But that’s bunkum. She comes into my dreams at
night, and stands between me and the sunlight. I can’t
play about with other women—or do more than play—until
I’ve cut out Joyce, and the wound is healed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pressed his hand with a sympathy that was good to
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Explain to Anna,” he said, “or she’ll think I’m heartless.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps she explained well enough. Anna von Wegener
was very demure next time she met Bertram, and only
showed by her blush that she remembered the scene in the
wood. She was with Dorothy and Von Arenburg at the
Schlesische Bahnhof when Bertram took the train to Riga.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall pray for you all the time,” said Dorothy. “Don’t
stay too long in that frightful country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take care of your health, my dear fellow,” said Von
Arenburg, grasping his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remember your friends,” said Anna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They waved hands to him until the train disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a long time he sat motionless in his carriage, thinking
of that chapter of life in Germany, and of the new
page he was about to turn. He might never come back
from Russia. Disease, starvation, crime, all kinds of
danger lurked in that unknown country. It was cut off
from the outer world. No letters passed, unless smuggled
through or sent under official seal. He doubted whether
he would get any news while he was there. Perhaps he
would never hear the end of the story of Joyce, his wife.
It would be strange never to know, until he passed to that
place where, perhaps, everything was known, even the
secret workings of the heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By his side was a bundle of letters from England, and
some copies of <span class='it'>The Times</span>, forwarded to Dorothy’s address.
He opened them, but left most of them unread.
They were just trivial letters from acquaintances and
tradesmen. <span class='it'>The Times</span> interested him more. The King
had gone to Belfast to open the Northern Parliament. He
had made a speech, pleading for forgetfulness and forgiveness.
There was talk of a Truce—a Treaty of Peace.
At last! Thank God for that! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. British trade returns
were still going down. Unemployment was going up.
There were the usual lists of births, marriages, and deaths.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Deaths! His eyes fell on four lines of small print.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Murless</span>, on the 19th of this month, at the British Embassy
in Paris, the Honourable Kenneth Murless, of pneumonia.
Aged twenty-seven.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram read the lines three or four times before the
meaning of them fully reached his consciousness. He uttered
a sharp exclamation, startling the German folk in his
carriage. In his mind was a strange mingling of pity for
Joyce and gladness for himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth had died not much more than a month after the
dinner at the Griffon. Perhaps Joyce had not gone to him
so soon.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was a rotten way of looking at things. What a
tragedy for Joyce! And for Kenneth, that very perfect
gentleman, who had tried to play the game “according to
the rules!”</p>

<div><h1>XLVIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The journey to Riga had not been too bad, except for
examination of passports and luggage at odd times
of the day and night, at unexpected frontiers. This happened
each side of “the Polish corridor,” which had been
made by the Treaty of Versailles like a wedge driven
through Germany to Danzig. It happened again on the
frontiers of Lithuania and Latvia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An American in the train called it the “Get-in-and-get-out-express.”
It stopped for six hours at Eydtkuhnen on
the border of East Prussia, and there was time to walk
about and see something of the devastation made by the
great Russian drive in the early years of the war. Here
were still the blackened ruins of farmhouses and barns and
peasants’ cottages, but German industry had built up the
villages again, very neat and pretty under their new red
roofs, wonderful in contrast to the poor attempts at reconstruction
in the war zone of France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram had to wait four days in Riga before he could
get a train to Moscow. The Soviet agents there were unhelpful
and rather insolent. The stamp of the Moscow
Executive Committee on his special passport did not seem
to inspire them with any zeal. They informed Bertram
that he might have to wait three weeks for a train—or
longer. The thought seemed to amuse them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three weeks in Riga! The idea was affrighting because
of its boredom. In three days Bertram had exhausted the
interests and amusements of a city that seemed dead all
day and only wakened to life at one in the morning, when
the night cafés and dancing-halls were filled with a company
of Letts, Poles, Russians, Finns, and Germans, drinking
large quantities of <span class='it'>schnapps</span> in quick gulps until their
eyes watered and their noses reddened, and they became
quarrelsome with their women and each other in a medley
of languages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In one of these cafés Bertram sat opposite an American
who opened a friendly conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Staying long in this City of Departed Glory?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not longer than I can help. I want to get to Moscow,
but the trains don’t work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The American asked his business there, and raised his
eyebrows with a smile when Bertram said, “Journalism. I
want to find out the truth about the famine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there’s a famine, I’m told,” said the American.
“You might call it a famine, without much exaggeration.
About twenty-five million people starving to death, more
or less. I’m pushing up some food. A relief train is
going to-morrow with the first supplies. That’s my job.
I’m A. R. A.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pronounced the letters as though they spelt a word—“Ara.”
They conveyed nothing then to Bertram, though
afterwards he came to know them as the greatest hope of
life in Russia for the starving children from Petrograd to
the Volga Valley, and the Russians spoke of “Ara” as
though it were God. It meant the American Relief Administration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any chance of a place on that train?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The American smiled again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expected that question. Is your passport all right for
Moscow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram showed it, and the American nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any objection to lice?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t invite them to dinner,” said Bertram, “but we
were on speaking terms in the trenches. ‘Chatty,’ the
men used to call it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ll give you the glad hand in that <span class='it'>train de luxe</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I can get a place?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll fix you up. Better take supplies with you. Cheese.
Biscuits. A kettle. Enamel mugs. Candles. Blankets.
There’s not a restaurant car, nor a <span class='it'>wagon lit</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled grimly, and Bertram knew why on the next
night when he boarded the train to Moscow. It was nearly
midnight, and the station was dimly lit, and after stumbling
over grass-grown rails, Bertram found a train in darkness,
except in one or two carriages where candles had been
lighted and put on the window ledges. A number of Lettish
porters staggered along under heavy bundles, and there
were more of them in the corridor of the train from which
a frightful smell met the open air. The carriages were
wooden compartments, stripped of all upholstery, with
plank beds, and they seemed to be entirely occupied by
Americans and Russians who were quarrelling with each
other for vacant possession. There was a jabber of both
languages rising into violent oaths of the choicest brand
from New York, Omaha, Kansas, and Kentucky. One
voice rose higher than all the rest, with a bull-like bellow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For Christ’s sake! If all you Tavarishes don’t get out
of this bug-box, I’ll get the Cheka on to you and have you
minced by Chinese torturers!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The owner of this voice, as Bertram saw in the candlelight
of one carriage, was a young man of Herculean build,
in a felt hat, Garibaldi shirt, riding-breeches, and top boots.
To make clear the mystical meaning of his words, he seized
one of the porters, lifted him up as though he were a sack
of potatoes, and flung him at six others massed in the dark
corridor. It had the effect of clearing a space and creating
a moment’s quietude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who the hell are you?” asked the genial giant, peering
at Bertram and putting a flash-light close to his nose. “Do
you belong to this outfit?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram mentioned the name of the American who had
“fixed him up.” It was an ordinary name, but produced
an immediate and softening effect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good enough! You’re the young guy who’s going to
the famine districts? Glad to meet you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram found his hand in an enormous fist, and recovered
it in a limp and boneless state.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My name’s Cherry,” said the young giant. “I’m from
Lynchburg, Virginia. I do the courier stunt for Ara, from
Riga to Moscow. I also boss this train, and make it move.
When it stops, I make it move again. Sometimes. If I
get out and push. I inspire terror among Tavarishes.
When they play tricks I treat ’em rough. When they play
straight I’m full of loving-kindness. It’s the only way to
get anything done by these lousy Tavarishes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s a Tavarish?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A Comrade,” said Cherry of Lynch, Virginia. “It’s a
nice way of saying Bolshevik. Call them Tavarish all the
time. It makes them feel good. Human equality and all
that punk. Have you brought any bug-powder?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll lend you some. Otherwise you’ll be eaten alive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But for Cherry, Bertram would have reached Moscow
even more of a wreck than he did. In spite of the powder,
he was attacked by many different species of insect as he
lay on an upper plank, with Cherry beneath. He saw
them crawling in legions up the wooden walls. They ambushed
him beneath his blanket, sent out scouts and advance
guards and then attacked in mass formation. The
nights were torture. In the day time the enemy retired to
their hiding places.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The train was crowded with Russian and Lettish couriers,
all in charge of heavy packing-cases and sacks. Next to
them, four to a carriage, was a contingent of young
Americans, going out as clerks to the headquarters staff of
the A. R. A., in Moscow. Certain mysterious young men
who talked to each other in low voices, were pointed out
by Cherry as Russian Soviet officials belonging to the secret
police of the Extraordinary Commission, known as
“the Cheka,” because each letter of that dreaded word
formed the initial of the full Russian title for this organisation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no heat in the train, and it was cold after
crossing the Russian frontier in the rainy season of early
autumn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram’s cheese and biscuits, which he had bought in
Riga, became utterly distasteful to him after two days, and
he yielded to Cherry’s insistent invitation to share his
bully beef, pork and beans, tinned butter, and fresh bread.
It was Cherry, also, who taught him how to get the one
source of comfort available on Russian journeys—a plentiful
supply of hot water at every wayside station. The
pass-word was “kipyitok,” and this was yelled by Cherry
to the <span class='it'>provodnik</span>, or guard, of the train, who filled the
passengers’ kettles so that they could make tea in their
carriages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Russian frontier was at a place called Sebesh, the
other side of a long stretch of flat, barren, abandoned country
which seemed to be a kind of No-Man’s Land. The
train was immediately boarded by a number of hairy men
in sheepskin coats and fur caps, accompanied by two
soldiers of the Red Army. Bertram felt a thrill at his
first sight of Bolsheviks and Red Soldiers. His mind went
back to the atrocity tales of Countess Lydia and her sister,
and other refugees from the Russian Terror. These men
who pushed their way down the corridor were agents of
that terrible new social code and faith which had declared
war upon all civilisation based upon individualism and private
property, and proclaimed Communism as the new gospel
which mankind must accept, whether they liked it or
not. Those soldiers represented the power by which that
code was enforced upon one hundred and fifty million
people. It was their Army which had defeated Koltchak,
Denikin, Judenitch, Wrangel, and all the counter-revolutionary
forces—financed, armed and equipped by the Allied
Powers—which had invaded Russia, laid great districts
in ruin and flame, hanged many peasants to the
branches of trees, and retreated in disorderly masses from
the relentless pursuit of “the Reds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two soldiers escorting the hairy Bolsheviks were
not formidable in appearance. They were both about eighteen,
with puffy, pale faces, and a hang-dog, under-fed look.
They wore long grey overcoats, reaching to their heels,
and curious cloth caps, shaped like Assyrian helmets, with
stiff peaks behind, and in front the Red Star, five-pointed,
of the Soviet Republic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See how these Tavarishes love me!” said Cherry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Certainly the small group of Bolshevik officials who came
to examine passports and baggage, greeted Cherry with a
kind of forced amusement, in which, as it seemed to Bertram,
there was a hint of fear. Perhaps it was due to the
vice-like grip with which he insisted upon shaking hands
with them; and the bear-like way in which he thumped
them on the back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Dobra den, Tavarish!</span> How goes it, old face-fungus?
<span class='it'>Kraseeva</span>, eh? Fine and dandy, what? Well, <span class='it'>dos vidanya</span>,
you darned old hypocrite, and don’t you come poking your
nose into my car. <span class='it'>Niet! No pannamayo?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He fondled the head Bolshevik’s beard, patted him playfully
on both cheeks, gave him a mighty dig in the ribs
which took his breath away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s how I treat ’em,” he told Bertram. “A touch of
good humour works wonders with them. Look at those
two young murderers! Laughing like hell! It’s the first
time they’ve laughed since I came this way before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two young soldiers regarded him with eyes of wonder
and admiration, between guffaws of laughter. When
he stepped down on to the platform, a group of Russian
porters and peasants gathered round him, listening to his
oration in American and Russian, gazing at his mighty
girth with astounded smiles. He towered above them, and
occasionally pushed at a man’s chest, and pummelled a
Russian boy with ogre-like playfulness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Six hours at Sebesh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come and see the flight from the Famine,” said Cherry.
“It’ll take away your appetite for my bully beef. Cheap
for me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He strode down the rails for five hundred yards and
halted before a long stationary train without an engine.
It was divided into a number of box-like cattletrucks, from
which, as they drew near, came a pestilential stench through
half-opened doors. In the dirty straw of each of the
trucks squatted a group of human beings, men, women,
and children. They were hunting vermin in their rags.
Some of them lay curled up in the straw, sleeping, or dying.
Perhaps dying, thought Bertram, for even those who were
sitting up had a grey, haggard, deathly look, as they stared
out at him with deep-sunk eyes, in which there was no
interest, no life, no spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Letts,” said Cherry, “on their way home from the
famine districts. They’ve been dying all the way. Hunger,
weakness, typhus. Look at that girl. Typhus, beyond
a doubt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl was lying on the grass by the side of the train.
Her head turned from side to side. Her face was flushed
and puffed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the vermin that gets ’em,” said Cherry. “They’re
eaten up with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A tall, bearded peasant, clothed in rags tied about him
with bits of string, came up to Bertram and spoke to him
in English, with an American accent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, mister, can you change a hundred thousand roubles
into German marks?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram laughed, and was astounded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A hundred thousand roubles! I’m not a millionaire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No need to be,” said Cherry. “It’s worth about six
shillings in English money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took some dirty bits of paper from the bearded
peasant, and gave him some German notes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There you are, Nunky. How do you come to speak the
American lingo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I worked in Detroit,” said the man. “Before the world
went wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where do you come from?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ufa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned and pointed eastward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three thousand miles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long on the road, brother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Five months. I am nearly at the journey’s end. Across
the frontier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is it in Ufa?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man looked at Cherry with tragic eyes. He spoke
in simple, Biblical words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In Ufa there is great death. The people have no food.
The mothers are glad when their children die, because
it is sad to hear their weeping. I am one who escaped
in time. God has forsaken Russia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess that’s a sure thing,” said Cherry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Back in the train to Moscow the American boys were
singing negro choruses in harmony, and queer rag-time
songs from the Winter Garden, New York. Cherry went
into their carriage, and led new choruses, and college
yells, with his enormous hands. Spasmodically, hour after
hour, until late at night, these songs broke out, while Bertram
lay alone on the wooden plank above Cherry’s bunk,
with his thoughts travelling faster than that slow-going
train which every hour or so panted like an exhausted
monster, reduced speed to a crawl, made one or two ineffective
jerks and tugs, and then came to a dead halt.
There was no more fuel. The provodnik and his comrades
descended and searched around for logs of wood. Cherry
stimulated their energy by shouts and curses, and roars of
laughter, and back-thumpings, and general noises of encouragement
to make them “get a move on.” One hour,
two hours, three hours—once fourteen hours—passed before
the train lurched forward again with an immense rattle
of wheels and wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram stared out of the window for hundreds of versts,
at the flat, dreary, monotonous panorama of Russia. It
seemed lifeless and abandoned, except at wayside stations
where groups of peasants stood about the wooden sheds,
staring at the train as though it were a miraculous advent.
Away from these stations there was but little sign of human
life. Now and then Bertram saw a <span class='it'>droschke</span> driving along
a road which led to some distant village of wooden houses
with a white-washed church rising above them. A woman
gathering faggots with one hand while she carried a baby
in her shawl, raised her head and looked at Bertram as
the train halted near her bundle of sticks. It seemed to
him that she had some message for him in her eyes. She
drew her shawl on one side, and showed her child, a little
wizened thing, monkey-like.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At another place a peasant was kneeling before a wayside
<span class='it'>ikon</span>. He knelt with his head bent and his beard on
his chest, and crossed himself again and again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An immense melancholy came out of this Russian landscape,
and darkened Bertram’s spirit. In imagination, without
knowledge, by instinct only, he was stirred by the sense
of travelling through a country of despair and immeasurable
misery. The silence of the countryside was intense
and brooding. No sound of laughter, of human gossip,
even of human toil, came from its woodlands or open
fields. There was no clink of hammer on anvil, no rhythm
of an axe at work, no shout of ploughman to his team.
The peasants in the wayside stations seemed to have no
work to do, no object in life, except to stand and stare
with gloomy eyes. “God has forsaken Russia,” said the
man from Ufa. The vital energy of life itself seemed to
have burned low in these people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Away back in the train an American chorus rang out.</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Nigger melodies, Russian forests, the chug-chug of the
train, Cherry’s boisterous voice, the sad eyes of a peasant
woman with a sick child, a line of bugs crawling up the
carriage wall, the smell of a Latvian cheese, the melancholy
of life, the isolation of the human soul, the death of
Kenneth Murless, the mystery of Joyce, the typhus-stricken
girl lying by the railway line, the endless monotone of this
Russian landscape, the puzzle of his own life, made up the
incoherence of Bertram’s thoughts on the way to Moscow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth’s death would make no difference, except to
Joyce. No difference to Bertram. He had left Joyce
forever. She had finished with him, and he with her.
Perhaps she would go back to Holme Ottery for a time,
until the American took possession. What did it matter
where she went? He must cut her out of his mind. It
was only a year’s habit, and weak sentiment, that made
him think of her so much, with a dull ache of pain.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
How long to Moscow, on this abominable journey? Damn
those bugs!</p>

<div><h1>XLIX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Moscow—and old Christy! Bertram saw him on
the platform amidst a group of Red soldiers, bearded
porters, and <span class='it'>droschke</span> drivers in fur caps and long blue
coats. He was wearing the same old grey suit in which
Bertram had last seen him in London, with the addition
of a sheepskin waistcoat. His lean, ugly face was twisted
into a humorous smile as he saw Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Welcome to our city!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God in Heaven!” said Bertram. “This is a grand meeting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some reason, inexplicable to himself, the sight of
Christy was like finding a solid raft after shipwreck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Follow me, and don’t rub shoulders with your fellow
men,” said Christy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He led the way from the platform into the station hall.
It was a great place with white-washed walls and filled
with such a stench of human filth that Bertram felt like
vomiting. The great floor space was entirely covered with
the heaped-up bodies of men, women, and children. They
lay piled up on sacks and bags, and across each other’s
legs and arms, in a tangled mass of sheepskins, rags, and
mangy fur, all brown with mud and dirt as though they
had been dipped in the slime of Flanders, as Bertram
had known it in war-time winters. It was nightfall, and
they were settling down to sleep, restlessly, so that there
was a heaving of bodies, and a tossing of arms. Some
slept with stertorous breathing. Children wailed. Girls
who were almost women lay in the arms of bearded men.
One man lay dead among the living, as Bertram saw at
a glance, not unfamiliar with death. His head was thrown
back on a bit of sacking, showing a thin, turkey-like neck
with loose wrinkled skin. His eyes were wide open and
glazed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s all this?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Refugees from famine,” said Christy. “The end of the
journey. To-morrow they go into camp. Apart from typhus,
they’re all right now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram breathed deeply of fresh air when they emerged
from the station.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can I get into a hotel?” he asked presently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you do what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy laughed quietly at the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is Bolshevik Russia! The Carlton doesn’t function
at the moment. There are no hotels. The <span class='it'>Narcomindjel</span>
provides you with a billet, if they like the look
of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who may they be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Soviet Foreign Office. East side Jews from New
York deal with us, mostly. Not bad fellows, if you’re
civil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Supposing they don’t like the look of me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy smiled grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll get another kind of billet. With bars to the
windows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any chance of that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not now. Bolshevism is busted. They want help from
the outside world. That’s why they’ve let me stay and
let you come. Things are changing pretty rapidly. I’ll
tell you all about it presently. First the Foreign Office,
and Mr. Weinstein.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hailed a <span class='it'>droschke</span>, spoke a few words of Russian—amazing
fellow!—and Bertram found himself driving
through Moscow at night, with Christy by his side. Moscow—or
some fantastic city of a dream after a goblet
of absinthe? The moon was up, and shone brightly down
upon a vision of white palaces, red walls, turreted gateways,
tall bell-towers, and clusters of pear-shaped domes,
all golden and glistening in the white moonlight. Under
the gateways were deep caverns of blackness, and high
walls with fan-shaped battlements flung black shadows
across broad squares all flooded with the moon’s milky
radiance. The <span class='it'>droschke</span>, pulled by a lean and wiry horse,
lurched over cobbled roads like a boat in a rough sea,
and pitched into holes and pitfalls which more than once
brought the horse to its knees. Under a gateway, very
narrow, with a turret overhead, a red lamp was burning,
and there seemed to be an altar in the little chamber
at the side, glinting with gilt candlesticks. The driver
pulled off his fur cap, and crossed himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The shrine of the Iberian Virgin,” said Christy. “A
thousand years old, and more powerful than Lenin in the
peasant mind!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a great open square on the other side of the
gateway, below a steep wall of red brick. At one end
of it was a fantastic church, with a twisted dome painted
in all the colours of the rainbow. In the high wall were
arched gateways, lit by hanging lanterns, guarded by Red
soldiers whose bayonets flashed like quicksilver. At one
angle of the wall was an open staircase of red brick,
leading to a high turret. Each of its steps was clear-cut
by a light behind, with strange theatrical effect. Beyond
seemed an endless vista of golden cupolas, surmounted
by shining crosses, above white walls, all glamorous and
shadow-haunted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Kremlin,” said Christy. “From that high tower—old
Ivan Velike—Napoleon saw Moscow burning, and read
his doom in its smoke and flame. We’re passing through
the Red Square. Every stone of it has been wet with
blood. Those walls have looked down on a thousand years
of human cruelty—not ended yet.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A cut-throat looking place,” said Bertram, and shivered
a little. There were few people about. There was no
sound in the city except the klip-clop of the lean horse,
and the footsteps of sentries pacing under the Kremlin
walls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It holds the biggest drama in the world,” answered
Christy. “What’s happening here is going to alter history
everywhere. Peace or war, perhaps civilisation itself, is
going to be decided by the brain that is working at this
hour of midnight, beyond those walls. The ruthless brain
of a fanatic who is also a realist. He experiments with
human nature like a vivisector with guinea-pigs, without
compassion, in the interests of science. To prove or disprove
a theory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lenin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lenin.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Genius or maniac? Damned if I know!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Foreign Office, which Christy called by its incomprehensible
name, was in a big block of buildings at the
corner of an open place beyond the Red Square. A young
soldier in an overcoat made for a bigger man, so that
the sleeves came below his hands, barred the way with
his rifle at the foot of a staircase, until Christy said,
“Tavarish Weinstein.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the top of the staircase, Christy plunged down a corridor,
turned sharply to the left, knocked at a door, and
opened it without waiting for an answer. It was well
past midnight, but at a desk heaped with papers, a man
sat working. He was a delicate-looking man, past middle
age, with a pointed beard and moustache, like a French
painter. Like such a type, also, he wore a jacket of
brown velveteen. He looked up at Christy’s entrance, and
Bertram saw that the pleasant aspect of his face was spoilt
by “crossed” eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good evening, Mr. Weinstein! This is my friend,
Bertram Pollard of <span class='it'>The New World</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glad to meet you, Mr. Pollard. A tiring journey, I’m
sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook hands with Bertram, with a limp, soft touch,
and spoke in a gentle, tired voice. As chief of the propaganda
department of the Soviet Republic, he did not come
up to Bertram’s expectations of a leading Bolshevik. He
might have been the editor of <span class='it'>The Ladies’ Home Journal</span>,
or one of the most respectable members of the Royal Academy.
He did not even look like a Jew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You purpose to visit the Famine region of the Volga?”
he asked Bertram, and then, in a melancholy voice, said
something about the tragic conditions in that part of Russia.
The Republic was doing its best to cope with them.
But it was very difficult. They needed foreign help. From
England and the United States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have nothing to hide,” he said presently. “Go
where you like, see what you like. Write what you like.
We only ask you to tell the truth. So many lies have
been told about us. Incredible! We welcome the truth.
We wish the world to know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My friend Pollard is a glutton for truth,” said Christy,
with just the flicker of a wink at Bertram. “Where are
you going to billet him, Mr. Weinstein? With me, I
hope?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly. You are comfortable?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Luxurious, even.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is good. We like to treat our guests well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rang up a number on the telephone, and spoke rapid
Russian. Then he turned to Christy again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is settled. Sophieskaya, 14. They have prepared
a room for him. Good evening, Mr. Pollard. I shall
read your articles with interest, I am sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy led the way out of the building, and asked
Bertram to get into the <span class='it'>droschke</span> again. They drove across
a bridge, turned at right angles along the bank of the river.
On the other side was an astonishing view of the Kremlin
again in the white moonlight, with great blocks of darkness
between its churches and palaces and towers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An ‘Arabian Nights’ Dream!” said Bertram, in a low
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy did not answer him directly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That fellow Weinstein is not a bad fellow. As gentle
as an invalid lady at Bournemouth. As subtle as a Chinese
mandarin. I don’t think he’d hurt a spider, willingly. But
of course he’d vote for the death of any counter-revolutionary,
man, woman, or child. That’s fear. Fear is the
father of cruelty. Well, here we are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>droschke</span> driver pulled up his horse with a clatter
of hoofs. Two soldiers standing by a sentry-box came
forward with a lantern, and held it up to Christy’s face,
and Bertram’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right, my children,” said Christy. “Now for
a hundred thousand roubles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In Heaven’s name, what for?” asked Bertram, still
ignorant of Russian money.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To pay the <span class='it'>isvostchik</span>—meaning the cabby. Hear him
howl when I give it him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy was right. The man wailed and whined, raised
his hands to heaven, called upon the moon as witness,
flung his fur cap on the ground, spat on the mass of paper
which Christy had given him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Skolka?</span>” said Christy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man renewed his loud plaint, until one of the Red
soldiers struck him on the chest with the butt-end of his
rifle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I paid him forty thousand roubles too much,” said
Christy. “He wanted fifty thousand more. Such is the
greed and dishonesty of man!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s this house?” asked Bertram, staring up at a
great mansion with a classical façade. “It looks like a
palace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s exactly what it is,” said Christy. “This is where
I live. Nothing less than a palace for dear old Christy!
An English aristocrat must have his four-poster bed and
Louis Quinze suite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went up a flight of steps and pulled a chain. There
was the loud jangling of a bell, and presently a great
rattling of bolts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They keep us under lock and key, so that we don’t
escape without paying our bill,” said Christy. “You’ll
find these Bolsheviks bleed the Western capitalist.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door was opened by a pretty, sleepy girl, with a
shawl round her head. She greeted Christy with a smile,
a yawn, and a German “<span class='it'>Güten Abend</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be frightened at anything you see,” said Christy.
“What you don’t see is much more alarming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first aspect of things was not frightening. Bertram
found himself in a great and splendid hall, panelled in
richly carved oak, with gilded decorations. Beyond was
a wide flight of stairs, leading up to a corridor hung with
tapestries. It was at the corner of the corridor that he
had his first shock. From behind a curtain, or through
some door which he had not seen, six figures appeared
in single file, utterly silent. They looked like Chinese
mandarins in wonderful robes of cloth of gold. Their
pig-tails swung as they passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy turned round and winked at Bertram, and then
led the way through a noble salon, all gilt and brocade, in
the Louis Quinze style. Round the walls were portraits
of men and women of the old régime, in white wigs and
flowered silks. Immense candelabra, like those at Versailles,
were suspended from a ceiling painted with cherubs
and naked goddesses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the farthest door another unexpected figure stood
motionless. It was a Turkish soldier in a red fez, and
embroidered sash round blue baggy breeches. Christy
passed through the salon, and led the way down another
corridor where Bertram was startled again by a man
suddenly opening a door, looking out, and shutting it with
a bang. In that brief glimpse Bertram had seen an Indian
prince, as he seemed, in a high white turban, and robe of
cream-coloured silk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Further down the corridor, another door opened, and
a man came right out into the passage. He wore a flannel
shirt and pepper-and-salt trousers, with his braces hanging
down. His feet were bare, and he was carrying a
wine-bottle in one hand and a wet sponge in the other.
He looked like a respectable butler in a good English household,
retiring for the night. As he passed Christy, he
crossed himself with the wine bottle, and squeezed a drop
of water out of the sponge on to the polished boards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Le diable est mort!</span>” he said, with great joyfulness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy passed into another room, which was an almost
exact reproduction of the Louis Quinze salon. A grand
piano was open, and a young man without a collar was
playing “Three Blind Mice,” with one finger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This way,” said Christy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pulled back a heavy curtain, opened a door, and led
Bertram into a room which might have been a king’s
study. It was panelled with oak, and furnished with oak
chairs and tables, elaborately carved with Gothic decoration.
A marble Venus stood on a high pedestal in the
corner of the room, and on one of the tables was a bust
of Napoleon. A figure of St. George and the Dragon in
coloured marble inlaid with gold, was in front of the
window, which looked across the river to the Kremlin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On an enormous hearth, with iron dogs, some big logs
were burning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two candles were alight in beer bottles, next to the
bust of Napoleon, and in the centre of the room was an
iron bedstead and a tin bath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here we are,” said Christy. “Home at last!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram was silent for a moment, looking unutterable
things. Then he asked a series of questions, quietly but
firmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me, have I gone raving mad? Or is this a real
house in Bolshevik Russia? Who were all those strange
people? Or did I only think I saw them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s quite all right,” said Christy, soothingly. “I know
how you feel, because I’d the jim-jams myself when I
first came here. This is the Guest House of the Soviet
Republic. It is also infested with the <span class='it'>Cheka</span> or secret
police, who will take down anything you say as evidence
against you, as the London Bobbies say, if you speak too
loud, and unwisely of dangerous things. It used to be
the palace of the Sugar King of Russia. It’s one of the
few houses in Moscow which was left untouched by the
Revolution.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those Orientals?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A mission from the Far Eastern Republic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That fellow with the wine bottle and the wet sponge?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An American newspaper correspondent. Jemmy Hart.
One of the best.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the dreamy fellow playing ‘Three Blind Mice’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kravintzki—one of the bright spirits of the Cheka.
His signature is necessary for all executions. That’s why
he plays the piano with one finger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t follow that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not to tire his wrist.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, now I know!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took hold of Christy’s arms and squeezed him tight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s good to see you again, you ugly old chameleon.
Let’s sit and talk. I’ve a thousand things to tell and to
ask. Since you left me I’ve been through the Slough of
Despond, and the Valley of Doubt. I’m carrying a dead
heart in my body. I’m in darkness, and can’t see a ray
of light ahead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you’re a cheerful kind of blighter to come to
Moscow!” said Christy, with a grin. “You won’t find any
rosy hope in the Volga Valley! Nor any blaze of light
’twixt Moscow and Petrograd. But let’s talk in front of
the fire. God, how good it is to talk! How good and
useless, except to one’s own soul!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All through the night in a Guest House of Bolshevik
Russia, they talked as only men can whose friendship is
proved. Bertram spoke a little of Joyce, and learnt that
Christy’s wife was dead. They were both lonely men, and
glad of this comradeship.</p>

<div><h1>L</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Moscow by day was more squalid, but more cheerful,
than Moscow by night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Kremlin as seen from Bertram’s “billet” in the
Sugar King’s palace was still magnificent and glittering
under the sun’s rays, but lost some of its mystery and
fantasy as he had seen it under moonlight. The streets
were no longer deserted, but crowded with every type
of Russian life, with Asiatics among them, as they existed
after a revolution which had destroyed one of the
richest, most luxurious, and most corrupt aristocracies in
Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Europe geographically, but Oriental in character and
race. It did not need Christy’s remark, “This is the East
and not the West, which explains a lot,” for Bertram to
see that. Many of the people in the streets of Moscow
were Eastern types, Slav and Tartar, and Semitic. The
typical peasants of Moscow had blue eyes and straw-coloured
hair, but the flatness of cheek-bone did not belong
to Western physiognomy. Some of them were Mongolian
in the slant of their eyes, in the blackness of their
hair, and the sparseness of their beards. They wore shaggy
goatskin caps brought far back behind their heads, with
a mass of mangy hair,—distinguished from the fur cap
of the usual Russian peasant. Men from the Caucasus,
wearing the astrachan fez passed by, with Cossacks of the
Don in long black coats, square cut across the shoulders
and falling to their feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These crowds were tramp-like in their way of dress,
careless of rags and broken boots. It was difficult to
distinguish any difference of class or caste among them,
except that Red Army officers and officials were smarter
than the rest, with top boots more weather tight, and
fur caps less shaggy. In the coldness of early autumn,
when the first snow began to fall, every one in Moscow
was muffled up to the ears with shawls or bits of fur,
and those who had no boots swathed their legs around
with wrapping over sandals or clogs and seemed warm
enough, and well enough shod for the mud and slush.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no visible sign of hunger in the faces of
the passers-by, and the children especially looked fairly
plump and healthy, surprisingly well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no famine here—yet,” said Christy. “There’s
an old proverb, ‘All things roll down to Moscow.’ It
holds good now. This is the seat of the Administration.
It’s stuffed with Soviet officials. They’ve a call on the
supplies of the country. And the kids get first serve.
It’s fair to say that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy was scrupulously fair to the Soviet Republic,
and Bertram thought he erred on the side of generosity.
He accused him even, though not seriously, of having
been “converted” to the black cult of Bolshevism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Christy in that long night talk had been illuminating,
and impartial. He had studied the Bolshevik theory and
practice, as he had seen it working, with a penetrating
vision. Theoretically, he thought there was a lot to be
said for the Communist idea. What was it, after all,
but an endeavour to carry out the commands of Christ
to His apostles who had “all things in common”? It
was a fanatical revolt against the crimes of Capitalism
and Individualism—Sweated Labour, Profiteers, Warmongers,
the blackguardism of Trusts, the corruptions and
cruelties of Caste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can’t deny these things,” said Christy. “We can’t
pretend that all is well with Western civilisation. As
we know, Pollard, it stinks with iniquity!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Soviet system was simple—in theory. In return
for service to the state, the citizen would receive food,
shelter, clothing, education, all the elementary needs of
life, and even its arts, graces, and amusements. Service
to the state was recognised by the membership of a Trade
Union. Once a man had his “ticket,” whatever his class
of work—it applied, of course, to women too—he drew
his ration of food, clothes, and so on, received his opera
and theatre passes, was entitled to all the culture and gifts
of the state.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very much like a soldier in the British Army or any
other,” said Christy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Soviet Government was made up of a body of men
elected as the Central Executive Committee by a series of
Soviets starting with the villages and sending one of their
members to a big and more important body. They elected
members in their turn to still more important groups,
until finally the Central Committee was reached.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very indirect,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Precisely. Not democratic. A weak point in the system.
The Central Executive is as far removed from the
people as the Greek tyrants.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Theoretically, however, the idea of common reward for
common service, thought Christy, was the ideal towards
which mankind had always been groping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And actually,” said Bertram, “how has it worked?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It hasn’t,” answered Christy. “It’s failed to work,
hopelessly. It’s landed them all into an unholy ruin. They
admit, with reservations, their own ghastly failure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chief cause of failure, beyond any doubt, was the
resistance of the peasant to the system of requisition. To
ration every citizen, it was, of course, necessary to commandeer
the peasant’s labour and produce. All that he
produced over and above his own needs belonged to the
State. Red soldiers went down to his farmstead to remind
him of the fact, and to collect his grain, potatoes,
flax, butter, vegetables, eggs, poultry, and milk. The peasant
said, “Why should I sow that others should reap?”
He concealed his produce, bartered it secretly for jewels,
furs, trinkets, any old thing, with city folk who didn’t
find their daily ration enough for daily life. When caught,
he was shot or imprisoned. When many had been shot,
the others ceased to sow, undercultivated their fields,—even
burnt their grain!</p>

<p class='pindent'>This peasant revolt against Communism broke the country,
already ruined by war, revolution, and counter-revolutionary
armies. The Central Executive could not get
their supplies to ration the city folk. Factory workers,
not getting food, abandoned the factories for the fields.
No more engines could be made or repaired. The transport
system broke down. It became more difficult to convey
food to the cities. They disintegrated. In Petrograd
there were three million people at the beginning of the
war. There were now seven hundred and fifty thousand.
All industry had ceased. No spades, ploughs, reaping
machines could be replaced. The whole machinery of
Russian life had collapsed. Now the Famine on the Volga
threatening twenty-five million people with starvation, had
hit the only class which was comparatively comfortable,
the peasants of Russia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much is the famine due to Bolshevism?” asked
Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy pondered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s due to the drought. Last year and this. An act
of God, as men say, though I don’t believe it, if there
is a God, and He is kind. But its severity was increased
by the System. The Bolsheviks requisitioned the peasants’
reserves to feed the Red Army defending Russia against
Koltchak, Denikin, Wrangel, and the rest. There were
droughts and famines in Russia before. The peasants expected
them, and kept reserves of grain for a lean year.
Now there are no reserves. In that way Bolshevism is
responsible for the famine. But in no other way. Let’s
be fair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re too damned fair,” said Bertram. “How about
the atrocities—the inhuman cruelties—the Chinese tortures?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy lowered his voice. They were talking in the
palace of the Sugar King, infested with secret police.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve no personal knowledge. The <span class='it'>Cheka</span> keeps its
secrets. There have been many executions—in batches.
Men and women, without mercy. Perhaps in Eastern Russia
Mongols have done the dirty work. But I’ll say just
this—to be fair again. All Governments, especially in time
of Revolution, are ruthless against those who challenge
their authority and seek to overthrow their power. So it
would be in any country in some degree. These people
hold their place against hordes of enemies, within and
without. They proclaimed the Reign of Terror against all
plotters and counter-revolutionaries. Fear made them
cruel. Fear made them kill the Czar, as the French killed
poor old Louis and Marie Antoinette. Now there are no
more counter-revolutions, and the Terror has abated.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why have counter-revolutions ceased?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The people are sick of bloodshed. The game’s too dangerous.
And Russia is so stricken that even the last of
the old régime, who still linger on in holes and corners,
believe that the overthrow of the Soviet Republic would be
the last blow to the life of Russia. At least it functions. It
makes a train move, now and then. It gets some supplies
from the peasants. It sends some seeds to the Volga valley.
It works.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And it has abandoned Communism.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that?” asked Bertram, astounded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The whole thing has been scrapped by Lenin, its chief,
author and organiser. On October the eighteenth he ‘blew
the gaff’ on the whole show, confessed the utter breakdown
of the Communist system—for the reasons I’ve given,
and some others. ‘We’ve suffered a terrible defeat on
the Economic front,’ he said. ‘The only way by which we
may save ourselves is by a strategic retreat on prepared
positions. He’s restored private property, to a great extent,
and the right of private trading, as you’ll see. He
has abandoned rationing, and re-established money for
wages and payment. The kind of money I paid to our
<span class='it'>isvostchik</span> last night—the <span class='it'>droschke</span> driver! Four hundred
thousand roubles to the English pound. One has to carry
a carpet-bag instead of a purse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God!” said Bertram. “An awful mess!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The worst mess in the world. The greatest tragedy in
modern history. Another experiment in human progress
has ended in disaster to a hundred and fifty million people.
Famine has stricken them, and will creep even to the edge
of Moscow before the winter is out. Pestilence sweeps
them like a scourge. And Lenin, in the Kremlin, is trying
to think of some way out of ruin. I think he’s found
a way, which at least he will try.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy lowered his voice still further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alliance with Germany. Red soldiers in exchange for
railway engines. Arsenals in return for economic aid. A
threat of war to France and Poland, with all the Continent
afire, unless Europe comes to her aid. International blackmail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s Hell,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it happens,” answered Christy. “You’ve just come
in time to see the transition from Communism to Capitalism.
You’ll find it interesting before you get down to
the Famine. This city is a melodrama, if you keep your
eyes open.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram kept his eyes open, and his ears. Building on
Christy’s outline of information, he was able to fill in the
details of Russian life from personal observation, and
plunged into it.</p>

<div><h1>LI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>He saw something of the melodrama of Moscow in the
Trubnaya Market, which had been opened again,
owing to Lenin’s new law allowing private trading. Until
that time, all private barter had been forbidden under
severe penalties, yet it had gone on secretly between city
folk and peasants and, as Bertram found afterwards, there
was hardly a man or woman in Moscow or Petrograd,
outside the class of Soviet officials, who had not been
imprisoned for this “crime.” Now it was done publicly,
and legally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram walked through the market which covered a
great square with dilapidated houses, pock-marked by bullet-holes,
on each side. There were rows of wooden booths
with room enough between them for three people to walk
abreast, all crowded with peasant folk in their sheepskins.
They were selling the produce of their little farmsteads,
and the food made a brave show in the capital city of
a famine-stricken land. Bertram saw plenty of meat, butter,
cheese, and bread. For those who had paper money
in big enough bundles, here was nourishment enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were other people besides peasants. Standing on
the outer edge of the wooden rows, were long lines of
men and women—mostly women—who, he saw at a glance,
were not peasants. Some of them were in peasant dress,
but their faces could not disguise a heritage of education
and gentility. Others wore the clothes of the old régime,
of bourgeoisie and Western fashion—black dresses, frayed
and worn and grease-stained, leather boots, down at heel,
or broken at the toes, hats which had come originally,
perhaps, from smart modistes in the Nevsky Prospekt, or
even from Paris, a bit of lace at the throat and wrists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These ladies, for they were that, stood in the market-place
holding out the last relics of their former state—ermine
stoles, fur tippets, embroidered slippers, fine linen,
old boots (less broken than those they wore), cloth jackets,
silk petticoats, trinkets with glittering stones, gold lockets,
rings, lace, embroidery, perfumes, combs, hair pins, brooches.
Some of them seemed hardly able to stand, and were thin
and weak and haggard. Bertram noticed their hands, delicate
and finely shaped, but grimed with dirt of hard work
and lack of soap. Gipsy hands of patrician women. They
avoided his eyes when he looked at them. They seemed
startled by his own appearance, knew him instantly as a
man of the class that was once theirs, and shrank from his
scrutiny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One girl, younger than the others, flamed scarlet at his
glance, and turned her head away with visible distress.
He did not look at her again, in order to avoid this hurt
to her pride, and indeed he had a sense of shame in
walking down the lines of those women, scrutinising their
faces, witnessing this public humiliation of their pride.
Yet he had an intense wish to get into conversation with
them, to find out their way of life. They were the last
of the old régime within the frontiers of Russia, less lucky
than the Countess Lydia and her sister, and all the crowds
of émigrés who had escaped in time. What stories they
would have to tell! What agonies they must have suffered
before arriving at this market-place!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood in front of an elderly woman who was holding
out a little tray on which was a gilt crucifix. She
had a thin face, with grey hair almost white, beneath a
little black bonnet. He asked the price of her crucifix,
speaking in French, and at his question her hands trembled
so that she could hardly hold the tray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you speak to me in French?” she asked, replying
in the same language.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guessed you spoke French. And I don’t know a word
of Russian.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not French?” she said, looking timidly into his
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m English.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She answered him in his own tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought so when I saw you before you spoke. How
do you come to be in Russia? Few foreigners come here
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m a newspaper correspondent. I’ve come to write
about the Famine, when I can get as far as that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is misery to be found without going so far,”
she said. “There are many who are hungry even in Moscow.
I am one of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I buy your crucifix?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She glanced nervously on each side, and spoke to him
in French again in a low voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are being watched. It is very dangerous for me
to be in the market place. They do not like my name.
Perhaps you would be good enough to go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was aware of a young officer of the Red Army standing
three paces away, watching and listening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Au revoir, madame.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned away, stared into the face of the officer, and
went further down the line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl who had flamed scarlet at his glance was still
there, and gave him a strange, wistful, lingering look
which startled him. Then, as he drew near, she left her
place in the line, and went to the lady with whom he had
been speaking and whispered to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These people were frightened, in spite of the “New Economic
Laws” which permitted private trading. They had
come out into the open, but were not certain of this new
liberty. Perhaps they had been trapped in some such way
before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After wandering about the streets and markets of Moscow
for a long morning, Bertram became conscious suddenly
of hunger, and he puzzled as to the way in which
he could satisfy this desire. It was a long tramp back
to his Guest House, across the river, and it would be more
amusing to find an eating house of some kind. Christy
had told him that two had just been opened in a street
called the Arbat, the only two in Moscow—a city of two
million people—which once was crowded with restaurants
as luxurious as any in the world. He hailed a <span class='it'>droschke</span>,
and by good luck made the <span class='it'>isvostchik</span> understand the name
of the street, paying him a hundred thousand roubles from
a wad of paper advanced by Christy, for the short drive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man seemed satisfied, touched his fur cap, and said,
“<span class='it'>Spaseeba, tavarish</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few shops were open down a long street of houses
which had all been shops, by the look of them, but were
now mostly empty and boarded up, and falling into ruin.
The newly opened places had a few objects of merchandise
in the windows. A pair of top boots, marked at a million
roubles, adorned one window-front. In another were three
fur caps, a guitar, a German pipe, and a wicker cradle.
A motley collection of household goods—including a leather
arm-chair, a broken bedstead, some rather good rugs, a
cloisonné clock, and a rosewood piano—was the greatest
display of “stock” which he could observe through any
window. In most cases there was nothing but what could
be seen at a glance. The “private trading” in Moscow
was not yet magnificent. He discovered the restaurant
by the sight of an uncooked leg of mutton, baldly displayed
in one of the windows, and by the words, “Angliske Restaurant”
written in Russian characters above it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he entered, he saw a bare room set out with
wooden chairs and tables, with here and there a piece of
furniture of the Louis XV. period, and on the walls some
gilded mirrors of the same style. A woman, shabbily
dressed, and wearing carpet slippers, but with an unmistakable
air of elegance, was stirring something in a pot
over a wood fire. At the back of the room was a long
counter, on which stood some tall bottles, a samovar, and
some coffee cups, and behind it, on a high stool, sat an
elderly man with silver hair and a little white beard. He
was peeling some potatoes, while behind him, with her hand
on his shoulder, was a girl of sixteen or so, as poorly
dressed as Cinderella, but as pretty, in a dark way, with
large brown eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram was aware of three pairs of eyes upon him,
studying him intently, with surprise and suspicion. The
woman who had been stirring the pot, advanced with her
ladle, pointed to a table, and spoke in Russian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He answered in French, and asked politely whether he
might have something to eat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do not understand Russian?” she answered suspiciously,
in French.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not a word, alas! I’m English—just arrived in
Moscow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“English!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spoke the word in his own tongue, with joyful intonation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you leave happy old England to come to this
miserable land?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To help the starving people of Russia, if I can,” he
answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is brave of you,” she said. “There is much danger
in Russia, and no kind of comfort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She called to the white-headed man behind the counter.
“Nicholas, Katia, here is a gentleman just come from
England!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They came from behind the counter, and the elderly
man clasped Bertram’s hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I used to know England well, and love my memories
of it. I was a painter in those days. We lived in Cheyne
Walk, Chelsea. Katia was a baby then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl took Bertram’s hand, and dropped a curtsey
like an English debutante.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I remember England, just a little. It seems like a fairy-tale
now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They served him with some soup called Bortsch, and
afterwards cooked a piece of meat for him with some of
the potatoes which the elderly man had peeled; and while
he was eating, the lady talked to him rapidly, emotionally,
as though relieving the pent-up thoughts of agonising years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a tale of misery. Her husband, now peeling potatoes,
had been a painter at the Imperial Court, and known
to be a personal friend of the Empress. He had been arrested
by the <span class='it'>Cheka</span> and thrown into prison, where he was
kept without trial for eighteen months, half-starved, in a
foul cell crowded with men of good class. Many times he
was examined at night by the Extraordinary Commission,
mostly young lads who tried to bully him into admission
of counter-revolutionary acts. Each time he believed he
was being taken to execution, like others in the cell who
were taken out and shot. For some reason they had spared
him. Perhaps because he was an artist, and they pretended
to reverence art, though they had no reverence for
life. She and Katia had been turned into the kitchen of
their beautiful house, which for a time had been used as a
billet for Red soldiers—rough country lads who stabbed
their knives into her husband’s canvases, used the tapestries
to wipe the mud off their boots, and were unspeakably
filthy in their habits. She had been very much afraid
for little Katia. Those young soldiers had been rough
with her, as they were with peasant girls.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She
and the child had starved many days. They would have
starved to death unless they had sold, secretly and at great
risk, some of the jewels they had hidden. They sold them
to peasant women for potatoes and cheese. Now the
peasant women were hungry themselves because of the
drought! She had worked at the hardest toil, chopping
wood, shovelling snow, dragging sledges to Government
stores.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at my hands, monsieur!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She showed her hands, coarsened and begrimed, like a
gipsy’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she had been arrested for the crime of private
trading, and imprisoned for six weeks. All that time she
had thought only of Katia, left alone with the brutal soldier-boys.
But God and His angels had guarded the child.
Two months after coming out of prison her husband was
liberated, without explanation or excuse. Just pushed out
of prison with the words, “<span class='it'>You can go, tavarish!</span>” That
was happiness beyond words, to be together again, in spite
of poverty and starvation and coarse toil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have suffered less than others,” said the lady. “We
have been lucky. My friends have been worse treated by
the cut-throats and robbers who rule our unhappy country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her husband whispered to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush, my dear. For the love of God—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A look of terror came into his eyes, because two young
men came into the restaurant and sat down at a table near
the counter. The lady became as white as death for a
moment, lest they had overheard her words. But they
called for plates of Bortsch and talked together in low
voices, paying no heed to those who served them. They
were unshaven and dirty, with long over-coats and top
boots, caked in mud, and the Red Star of the Soviet Republic
in their caps showed them to be officials of some
kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no more conversation from the lady. She
went into a little back kitchen. Her husband, once painter
to the Imperial Court, peeled more potatoes. Katia added
up some figures on a slate, glancing over at Bertram with
a little smile about her lips and in her timid eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There seemed to be no sense of freedom, no respite from
fear in Soviet Russia. Those women in the market place
had been scared when he approached them. This little
family dared not talk a word before unknown men of their
own city.</p>

<div><h1>LII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m off to Petrograd for a couple of days,” said Christy
one night in the Guest House. “You’d better come
while you’re waiting for a train to the Volga district. I’ve
fixed it with Weinstein. Here’s your pass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This visit to Petrograd gave Bertram another impression
of Soviet Russia, broadened his outlook on the tragedy of
a great people, killed something more of the petty selfishness
of his own trouble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said something of the kind to Christy on the train
journey through endless fields sowed with rye six months
from another harvest time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I find Russia makes one forget one’s ego. It’s like
seeing the end of the world—the death of civilisation. It’s
absurd for the individual to whine about the loss of a collar-stud,
or a pretty wife, in the midst of an Empire’s ruin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A nice cheerful way of looking at things!” said Christy,
with his usual irony. “Heaven knows how gay you’ll be by
the time you get to the Volga Valley.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These people seem to be down to the bed-rock of primitive
existence,” said Bertram. “Nothing matters except
food and shelter, and escape from death. All the rest is so
much ‘jam,’ as my batman used to say. It simplifies things,
as war does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An easy process of simplification,” said Christy. “Another
war, or another drought in Russia, and a great part
of Europe will be simplified off the map.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a great silence in Petrograd. Heavy snow had
fallen, and lay deep in the streets, except where gangs of
men and women had shovelled a passage-way for sleighs
which drove slowly with a tinkle of bells. The Neva was
frozen over, and standing on one of the bridges, Bertram
stared at the panorama of the city, magnificent with its
vista of palaces, churches, vast galleries, and great blocks
of stone buildings which had once been the offices of the
Imperial Government and of world-wide trade, but grim and
black under snow-covered roofs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The silence of Petrograd was strange and fearful. There
was no sound of labour in the great factories across the
river. No smoke came from their chimneys. There was
no throb of engines, or clang of iron. Nothing moved on
the quaysides. The immense buildings with sculptured
façades on the side of the city were deserted of all life.
No man or woman went in. None came out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Along the Nevski Prospekt once, as Bertram knew, the
greatest highway of luxury in Europe, most of the shops
were boarded up like those in Moscow, and nothing was
being sold or bought. But there were people there, a sense
of life, in contrast to the deadly quietude in other streets.
With fur caps pulled down, and sheepskin coats tucked up
about their ears, and with snow-shoes over their boots, they
were dragging hand sledges over pavements covered with
frozen snow so slippery that Bertram found it hard to
walk without staggering or falling. The sledges were laden
with sacks of potatoes, logs of wood, or frozen meat, and
some of them were escorted by Red soldiers, as though this
treasure might be attacked on its way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram was aware of some difference between these
sledge-draggers and snow-shovellers of Petrograd and the
population of Moscow. They were not peasants, but city
folk of the old bourgeois class. Their clothes still showed
traces of fashions that had passed. Some of these women,
and young girls, dragging heavy loads, had frocks of a
style that would have looked well in Paris, or Berlin, or
London, before they had been torn, and grease-stained, and
mud-splashed. Elderly men, clearing the roads, wore
“bowler” hats, and coats with astrachan collars, and looked
like bank managers, or clerks, once respected in merchants’
offices, who had come down in the world to the level of the
doss house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of the younger Russians wore their rags with a
kind of swagger and cheerful unconcern, only intent on
keeping warm, by bits of sacking used as shawls round the
neck, or by wearing seamen’s jerseys under their black
jackets. Even in Petrograd youth had not lost all its spirit
of gaiety, and Bertram heard a laugh now and then from
young folk who went hurrying by, arm in arm. But the
general impression of the faces he passed was haggard,
mournful, and anxious. Christy gave an explanation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This city is running short of food. Moscow, with its
crowd of Soviet officials, has first call on supplies. These
people we pass are wondering if their next meal will be
their last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to talk to them,” said Bertram. “If only I knew
a bit of Russian! I want to see inside their lives.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Try them with French, or German, or English,” said
Christy. “Some of these people shovelling snow used to
spend the season in Paris, Berlin, London.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a woman selling cigarettes outside the station
whose life was revealed to Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She leaned against a wall, coughing, in a thin dress that
was no proof against a temperature of forty degrees below
zero. She was a middle-aged woman, with a thin face and
sallow skin through which the cheekbones showed. Bertram
asked her in French for ten of her cigarettes, and paid
her ten times too much, in filthy paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve given me too much,” she said, in a weak voice,
“and I have no change.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her French was more perfect than Bertram’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind the change,” he said. “It’s cold for you,
standing here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Soon I shall be dead,” she said. “Are you French?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, English.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stared at him with a kind of wonderment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Once I was a governess in England.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She mentioned the name of an English family, unknown
to Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have been here during the Revolution?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since the beginning of the war. My husband was shot
when Kerensky went. He was an officer, and his men killed
him, like so many others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are alone now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have a little son. He is dying of hunger. I cannot
earn enough to feed him. Sometimes I have thought of
killing him, but have not the courage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is terrible!” said Bertram. “How can I help you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should you help me?” she asked, in a harsh voice.
“What am I to you? I am only one of millions who starve
in Russia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave her a bundle of paper money, and she stared at
it with dazed eyes, and gave a little cry, not of joy, but of
anguish. Perhaps this charity from a stranger only sharpened
her sense of misery, made more poignant her knowledge
of inevitable death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram raised his hat, and moved away, joining Christy
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s useless, old man,” said Christy. “I began like that.
But I’ve chucked it up. How much did you give her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Five hundred thousand roubles. Surely that will help
her a little?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy shrugged his shoulders, and laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In this city one pays a hundred and twenty thousand
roubles for a pound of tea. Eighty thousand roubles for a
pound of bread. Sixty thousand roubles for ten cigarettes.
What can you and I do in private charity? It’s merely
pandering to one’s own sentiment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One can’t leave a woman like that without giving her
something. One’s coat, if one has nothing else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Useless, Major. Useless. There are millions like her,
as she said. We can do better than that. Our job is to
tell the truth about the agony of these people, so that the
outside world may help in a big way. Poke up the conscience
of all our Pharisees who pass by on the other side,
while Russia lies bleeding in the ditch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took Bertram to a camp for refugees from the famine
districts of the Volga.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You saw some of these on their way in the cattle-truck
trains. This is the end of the journey for some of them.
I’m told it’s worth seeing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was called a “camp,” but the refugees in the place to
which Christy went—there were many others round Petrograd—were
housed in the old Imperial Barracks—an immense
white-washed building on four sides of a hollow
square. It was worth seeing, as Christy said, but not
pleasant to see. Outside the thermometer told forty degrees
below zero. Inside there was no heat except that of human
bodies lying huddled together on bare boards. There
were thousands of peasants with straw-coloured beards and
blue eyes from Samara, and Saratoff, and other places
which soon to Bertram were to have a frightful significance.
They had with them their women folk and children who
squatted about in the barrack rooms or lay sleeping in tangled
heaps like those in the station at Moscow. A meal
was being served from the kitchen—thin potato soup, and
a square hunk of black sour-smelling bread, provided by
the Soviet Republic for these people of the sun-burnt valley,
once the richest granary of Russia. The soup was ladled
out to those who lined up in queue, with mugs and bowls,
but Bertram saw that many did not take their place in the
line. They lay on the bare boards, flopping their heads
from side to side, or very still, with glazing eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Typhus—dysentery—weakness,” said Christy, after some
words in German to a Russian doctor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor was a black-bearded man in a white surgical
coat. He had grave, thoughtful eyes behind his glasses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We do what we can,” he said, in German. “But the
food is hardly enough, and there are no medicines, no soap,
no change of clothes, no fuel for heat. Disease is spreading.
But we do our best.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Passing through the courtyard with Bertram and Christy,
he pushed back a wooden door, and beckoned them to look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inside was a great pile of dead bodies, thrown one on
top of the other, men, women, and children, mixed up
together in a huddle of death, with brown, claw-like hands
protruding from the mass of corpses, and faces staring
upwards, and here and there a bare limb revealed in its skin
and bone. They had been tossed on top of each other, like
rubbish for the muck-heap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two days dead,” said the Russian doctor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The End of the Journey,” said Christy, in a low voice
to Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram was sick for a moment in the corner of the yard.
This stench of death was worse than a battlefield.</p>

<div><h1>LIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>By favour of a Soviet official with whom Christy was
on terms of friendship—“a very mild type of Bolshevik,
like so many of them,” he explained—they were allowed
to visit the Port of Petrograd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it worth while?” asked Bertram; “I want the human
side of things. I want to know how people are living, and
suffering in this frightful country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy answered with a touch of rebuke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re not here for melodrama. This Port will tell us
why people are <span class='it'>not</span> living in Russia. And why there’s unemployment
in England. It was one of the gateways of the
world’s trade.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a mournful place. They stumbled over cables concealed
beneath the snow, and wandered in solitude past
docks and warehouses, empty of all shipping and merchandise.
Out in the snow lay numbers of ploughs and reaping
machines, brand-new in their crates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy inspected them, and read a word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Düsseldorf.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That tells a tale. Do you remember
what I said about a Russo-German alliance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why are they left rotting in the snow?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No means of transport, and Oriental inefficiency,” said
Christy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Further in the Port were three tramps flying the Swedish
and Danish flags, and one wide-decked vessel with one
funnel called <span class='it'>Tyneside Lass</span>, from Newcastle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy was excited by that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From little old England! What’s she doing? Let’s go
and see the Old Man!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the top of the gangway was a young skipper, who
looked surprised when Christy hailed him in his own tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glad to see you, gentlemen,” he said, with cheery greeting.
“Come into my cabin and have a spot. It’s biting
cold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He mixed a stiff dose for each of them, and raised his
own glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cheery oh!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you carrying to Petrograd?” asked Christy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Railway engines. All German. From Hamburg. My
owners have a contract to carry eight hundred. Four at
a time. It looks as if I’ll get frozen in, this trip.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy looked over to Bertram, and raised his eyebrows,
before asking another question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do the Bolshies pay for German engines, skipper?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some gold. Mostly diamonds and furs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sound business for Germany,” said Christy. “How do
you get on with the Bolshies?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young skipper shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The officials keep civil tongues. They’d better. The
stevedores are poor lousy bastards. Can hardly lift a cable
without breaking theirselves. Half-fed, and no guts. Start
work at eleven, and take two hours to get the cranes working.
Well-meaning enough. Some of ’em speak a bit of
English. There’s one that was Professor of Biology, or
some such thing, before the war. I gave him a slab of
cheese, and he wept tears and kissed my hand. I’ve no
use for this Bolshevism. It don’t seem to do a country any
good, though there’s some that think so in Newcastle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wished them good health, and waved his hand to them
from the top of the gangway as they went back through the
snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Major,” said Christy, using the old title as though they
were still in Flanders’ fields, “those railway-engines from
Hamburg give me furiously to think. Here’s the key to
Russia’s way of escape. Perhaps Germany’s also, if France
puts the screw on too hard. What about the Treaty of
Versailles—German indemnities—a French invasion of the
Ruhr—if Germany allies herself with Russia? Russia and
Germany <span class='it'>contra mundum</span>! A formidable combination, by
the Lord!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you jump a bit too far ahead?” asked Bertram.
“Four railway engines in a Tyneside tug don’t seem to justify
a prophecy of world war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remember Owen,” said Christy calmly. “Reconstructed
a Megatherium out of one tooth. These four railway engines,
with seven hundred and ninety-six to follow—and
those ploughs lying in the snow—mean that Germany is
getting her foot into Russia, doing business, preparing to do
more. For Russia’s sake I’m mighty glad, but it mustn’t
be left to Germany alone. If that happens, there’s going to
be Hell to pay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram was silent on the way back. Christy had the
gift of seeing far ahead, and his prophecies were rare, and
never rash. The individual did not interest him very much.
He thought more of the actions and reactions of peoples, of
mass movements, economic laws, world balances, the ebb
and flow of trade, the undertow of passions, and political
chances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night they went to the Marinsky Theatre, and lost
their way in the snow. With his few phrases of Russian,
Christy asked the way of a young lad in the uniform of a
Red soldier, and was answered in very good English.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you come with me, gentlemen, I shall be very glad to
show you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you English?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy laughed, and said his father was English, but
now dead. His mother was a Russian lady. She taught
languages, especially English, to students who came to her
at night after their day’s work. She received three thousand
roubles a lesson, and was never home till past midnight,
and then very tired. He chattered cheerfully as he
strode over the snow in heavy boots, a little fellow, with
bright eyes and a lively sense of humour. Yet it was not
a merry tale he told, though fantastic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was an important person for a time. They made me
President of Arts and Sciences. I gave lectures to working
men at night, on the origin of art, evolution, and elementary
biology.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How old were you then?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sixteen,” said the boy. “Now I am eighteen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked no more than fourteen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day he was arrested for counter-revolutionary opinions.
Some working-man had discovered that his father
was an “aristocrat,” or objected to his discipline in class.
Anyhow, he was denounced, and kept in prison for nine
months. His poor mother had nearly died of grief. Then
he was liberated, luckier than others who had been shot in
batches for the same suspicion. Now he was an office-boy
in a Government department.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s been perfectly rotten,” he said, using English slang
with a foreign accent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He halted outside the Marinsky Theatre, and saluted,
and then shook hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram tried to slip some money into his hand, but he
shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father was an English gentleman,” he said simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were tickets for sale in the theatre, according to
the “New Economic Laws,” but it was plain that most of
the people had passes, and it was explained to Christy by
a young Jew who spoke French, that it was a “Trade Union”
night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a performance of “Carmen,” magnificently staged,
and well played, but to Bertram and Christy the audience
was of more interest than the performance. The immense
and splendid theatre was packed with “the proletariat.”
Nearly all of them wore the Russian blouse, belted round
the waist, or the Red Army tunic. The women were dressed
very much like an audience in one of the poorer suburbs of
London, but here and there a few had ventured to put on
a bit of “finery”—a little lace round the neck and wrists,
a trinket or two. In the Imperial box sat a group of men
with black hair over their foreheads, like women’s “fringes,”
and grimy hands. Above their heads the Imperial Eagle had
been covered with the Red Flag of Revolution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram thought of the pale-faced Czar sitting there with
the Empress and their beautiful daughters, with high officers
and ladies of the Court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, by some curious association of ideas, he thought of
Joyce, as he had sat with her in the boxes of London
theatres, so beautiful, so exquisite in her evening frocks.
The Emperor and Empress and all their family had been
murdered. Joyce had disappeared from his life, by some
act of revolution which had murdered <span class='it'>him</span>, killed his spirit,
stone dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The body of Bertram Pollard sat in the stall of the
Marinsky Theatre at Petrograd, but it was not the Bertram
Pollard of Holland Street, Kensington, or “Somewhere in
France.” He had changed. He was a different man. This
visit to Russia was changing him still further. It made all
other things seem trivial and insignificant—the things he
had made such a fuss about. Ireland! It did not mean
much to the world in progress or reaction. That guerrilla
warfare was a Chinese cracker compared with the frightful
things that had happened here in Petrograd. The Social
Revolution in England—Holme Ottery up for sale! How
laughable, how negligible, compared with the utter extinction
of the Russian gentry!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Petrograd and Moscow put things in a different proportion.
The agony of these people made private troubles,
heart-breaks, love affairs, strangely small. Those dead
bodies in the barracks—they too put things in a different
proportion, made life itself of but little account, individually.
What was this new sense of proportion going to
mean to him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps he would find the meaning at last for which his
mind had been groping, like a man in a dark room. Perhaps
he would get outside himself in service to these people
who were so immensely stricken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A hundred thousand roubles for your thoughts,” said
Christy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m wondering what I’m here for,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy glanced at him sideways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To learn a bit of life. Perhaps to light a little lamp in
the darkness of a human heart. Anyhow to see ‘Carmen’
jolly well played!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young Jew who had spoken to them before, came up
during the entr’acte, when they joined the crowd in the
<span class='it'>foyer</span>, a strange, shaggy-haired, pale-faced crowd, very
cheerful on the whole, and enjoying their evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think of it?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Magnificent,” said Christy. “Who are all these people
in the audience?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Soviet workers of one kind or another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Communists?” asked Christy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young Jew smiled, and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are we still Communists under the New Economic
Laws? We’ve gone back to private trading, private property,
money instead of rations, foreign capital, if it can be
got.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do the people like the new way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s like a weight lifted off their shoulders! They’re
beginning to breathe again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lowered his voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m in a Soviet office. But like most Jews I believe in
trade, barter, property. All the same, the Revolution did
some good. The workers didn’t get free seats at the Opera
in the time of the Romanoffs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at them with shifty eyes, afraid that he was
talking dangerously, yet wanting to talk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bread and circuses are all right,” said Christy, “but
circuses without bread are poor fare.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young Jew couldn’t follow this allusion, and looked
mystified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was the Revolution very terrible in England?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What Revolution?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The English Revolution.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It hasn’t happened yet,” said Christy. “It won’t happen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young Jew was incredulous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have read a lot about it in <span class='it'>Prahvda</span>. That’s our
Soviet paper. All your people are starving, are they not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were pretty well fed when I left them,” said
Christy, laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young Jew did not believe him, by the look in his
eyes, but the curtain was rung up again, and they left him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They all think there’s been a bloody revolution in England,”
said Christy. “They get no news except the stuff
published for propaganda purposes. The outside world is
a mystery to them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will soon be to us,” said Bertram. “I’ve heard nothing
since I left Riga. For all I know England may have been
sunk beneath the sea. Or Ireland.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No such luck,” said Christy, making the obvious gibe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went back through the snow with the audience of
the Marinsky Theatre, to the music of sleigh-bells. That
night they slept at a place called the International Hostel,
which was another kind of “Guest-house,” mostly inhabited
by Soviet officials of high rank, and by German traders.
Most of the night was spent in catching bugs.</p>

<div><h1>LIV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Back in Moscow, Bertram made enquiries as to the
means of transport to the famine-stricken districts.
They lay two thousand miles east of Moscow, in the Volga
Valley, and the chief railheads were Kazan, Simbirsk, Samara
or Saratoff. If he could get as far as Kazan, he
might, with luck, find a passage on a boat down the Volga
to the other places. But he would have to look quick about
it, as far as the river trip went, because the Volga would
soon begin to freeze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Weinstein of the Foreign Office was not hopeful of
an early train.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think, perhaps, your best chance would be to link up
with a party of gentlemen from the A. R. A. for whom
a special train to Kazan is being provided this week or
next.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A special train! It sounded incredible! But Bertram
knew already the mighty power of “Ara” in Russia. Had
he not been fixed up by its influence from Riga to Moscow?
Had he not seen the inspiring work of Mr. Cherry of Lynchburg,
Virginia, with Bolshevik officials and railway porters?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first food ship had arrived in Petrograd from New
York. Groups of young Americans were already in far
outposts organising committees of Russians for the administration
of food relief. They had already started soup-kitchens
for starving children in Petrograd and Moscow,
and were pushing out supplies to Kazan and the Volga
Valley with a rapidity that took away the breath of Russian
officials to whom the word <span class='it'>Seichas</span>—immediately—meant
the day after to-morrow, or the week after next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Director of “Ara,” the American Relief Administration,
learnt that word first from his Russian dictionary, and
used it with terrible persistence to the Soviet authorities of
transport, to Russian station-masters, to foremen of gangs,
to engine-drivers, and any other people he could find who
had something to do with getting an engine to move and
trucks to follow it. He taught the word and its meaning
to young Americans from the Universities of Harvard and
Yale and Columbia and Virginia, who, after a glimpse of
war, had volunteered for Russian Relief as the next best
chance of getting in touch with life—and death. They too
used that word <span class='it'>Seichas</span>, with a Western meaning and added
American interpretations such as, “For the love of Mike,
why don’t you get a move on, you sons of bitches?”—even
to high Soviet officials, and lesser authorities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By some miracle, astounding to the Russians themselves,
trains began to move from Riga to Moscow, from Moscow
to the Volga, laden with food supplies for the starving children.
Although in the whole of Russia there were only
two thousand five hundred engines standing together, though
mostly immovable, instead of seventeen thousand five hundred
which moved before the war, the best of them began
to get steam up, pulled out with long train-loads of trucks,
did actually get somewhere, in spite of break-downs, lack
of fuel. Oriental methods of delay. “<span class='it'>Seichas, you Tavarishes!</span>”
said the Americans, at any kind of delay, and by
that mingling of cajolery and terror which was the method
of the genial Cherry, were getting some kind of efficiency
into the utter chaos of Russian railways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All these things Bertram learnt from Jemmy Hart, the
American journalist, whom he had met on his first night in
Moscow at the Guest House, when he appeared in his
flannel shirt and pepper-and-salt trousers, with a bottle of
wine in one hand and a wet sponge in the other. He had
been imprisoned as a spy by the <span class='it'>Cheka</span> before the arrival
of the A. R. A. Then he was let out, and treated as an
honoured guest of the Soviet Republic. Hence his “billet”
in the Guest House. He was on terms of familiarity with
Lenin, Chicherin, Radek and other high powers, to whom
he behaved as one old poker player to other experts of the
artful game, with cheery cynicism, ready to call their bluff,
or to double the stakes if they revealed a weak hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These fellows cringe, if you treat ’em rough,” he told
Bertram. “When they start their highfalutin about ‘the
Dictatorship of the Proletariat,’ ask them why they look so
well fed when twenty-five million people are starving to
death. Mind you, I’m not a counter-Revolutionary! I’d
rather back these Bolsheviks, crooks as most of them are,
than see fellows like Koltchak and Denikin trying to get
Czardom back on to the necks of these poor, lousy, simple
people.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. So you want to get to the Volga? Well, come
along to the Colonel and I’ll fix you up. I’m going too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Colonel was a West Point man, with a hard, handsome,
masklike face, which became human and friendly
when he smiled. He was not a waster of words or time,
and after a few enquiries as to Bertram’s mission, agreed
to give him a sleeping berth in the special train which was
being provided for himself and his staff. It was due to
start in a week’s time. Allowing for the Russian translation
of the word <span class='it'>seichas</span>, that meant two weeks at least.
He would raise Hell if it was longer than that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d better have a yarn with our Doctor Weekes,” he
said. “What he doesn’t know about bugs, typhus, dysentery,
plague, and dirt, needn’t worry you in this country.
He’ll tell you how to skip between the bad bacilli. It’s
worth while.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook hands with Bertram, and closed the interview.
It was good enough. Bertram need no longer worry about
Mr. Weinstein and the Soviet Foreign Office. Under the
wings of “Ara” he would be carried to the Volga and find
out the truth about the Famine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Trubnaya market a Russian girl spoke to him in
English. He recognised her as the girl who had flamed
scarlet when he looked at her in the line of barterers, and
afterwards looked into his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You spoke to my mother the other day,” she said. “She
was afraid because a man was watching. Now she is a
little ill, but would be most glad if you would have the
kindness to call on her. It is long since she has spoken to
an English gentleman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram said he would be glad to call. This girl’s face,
with her dark eyes and looped hair, would make it interesting.
In any case, he was in Russia to learn the inside of
life, if he could get so close. Here was a chance of
knowledge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How shall I find your mother?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is difficult,” she said, smiling in a friendly way. “We
do not live in the big house that was ours. But if you will
meet me at any time you say, at the corner of the Arbat,
where the houses were burnt down, I will take you to our
home. Perhaps after dusk would be safest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At seven o’clock, or eight, if you like,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At seven, then. My mother used to be Princess Alexandra,
in the old days. My father was Prince Alexander
Suvaroff. Perhaps you remember him at the Embassy in
Paris? Now he is very old and weak, and broken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And <span class='it'>your</span> name?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nadia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mine is Bertram Pollard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She asked him to repeat it, and said, “I shall remember.
It is very English.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were angry with me when I looked at you in the
market-place,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not angry. Ashamed. That was foolish. There
should be no pride left in Russia. We are all on the same
level now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wanted to talk with her, but she seemed uneasy lest
they should be seen together, and slipped away from him
among the crowds of peasants in the market-place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening, before seven o’clock, he stood at the corner
of the Arbat, by the burnt ruins of some houses. His feet
were deep in snow, and heavy flakes were falling. He
stamped up and down to keep his feet warm, until presently
a woman’s figure, snow-covered, with a fur cap tied under
the chin, stood beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good evening,” she said in English. “You are a little
early, I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you also, mademoiselle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was so afraid of keeping you waiting in the snow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was my idea too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come!” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They walked together up the Arbat, and then the girl
touched his sleeve, and turned down a narrow sidestreet,
and again out of that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not far now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently she stopped in front of a dilapidated building
standing back in a courtyard filled with bricks and rubbish.
She opened an iron gate, and crossed the courtyard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will see that we do not live in luxury, sir. You
must excuse our gipsy way of life. Now we are here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went down a narrow corridor smelling of bad drains,
and pulled a heavy curtain aside from a doorway which
had lost its door. Inside was a square room with uncarpeted
boards, dimly lit by an oil lamp, and barely furnished.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
An elderly man with a white beard and moustache sat
in a low chair made out of packing-cases, and lying on a
truckle bed, covered with a patchwork rug, was the lady
to whom Bertram had spoken in the market-place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is Mr. Pollard, mother,” said the girl, as she held
the curtain for Bertram to enter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How kind and good of you to come!” said the lady. “I
so wished to speak to you the other day, and yet I was
afraid! We have been through so many terrors that now
we tremble at any unexpected thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram bent over the truckle bed and kissed the delicate
hand that was held up to him. Some instinct of chivalry
or sentiment made him pay this homage to a lady of the
old régime, lying in this dirty little room, without a relic
of her former state.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father,” said the girl, “this is the English gentleman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not look like a prince, as he rose from his packing-case
chair. He looked at first glance like a dirty and dissipated
old fellow who had been sleeping on the Thames
Embankment. His trousers and frock coat were all baggy,
and patched, and grease-stained. His hands were encrusted
with dirt. But he greeted Bertram with a dignity
that no poverty could take away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a pleasure to meet an English gentleman again.
I knew England well before the war. You will excuse our
poor apartment. We are reduced to ruin, and but for my
dear wife and daughter, I should have no courage left.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He held Bertram’s hand with a lingering grasp, and then
glanced at his own with a sardonic smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have no soap at all, and it is hard even to get water
for washing purposes. We can, however, make you a little
tea, if you will give us the pleasure of drinking it with us.
Nadia, there is enough tea for us all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, father. I will make it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For four years,” said the old man, “we have lived on
bread and tea, bread and tea, bread and tea. It is hard
to keep one’s courage on such a diet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is better now that we can sell a few little things in
the market place,” said the lady. “Is it not so, Alexander?
In spite of the <span class='it'>Cheka</span> we managed to hide a few treasures!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear,” said the old man, “one never knows who
may be listening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glanced nervously towards the curtain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is safe to speak in English,” said his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must have suffered terribly,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not to be put in words,” said the old man. “I
marvel that I have not gone mad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They tried to put into words the story of their suffering,
and told Bertram enough to let him imagine the rest. They
had been turned out of their palace, like all the others,
and the Prince had been put into prison before he had a
chance of escape. Nadia had escaped. She was in Paris
when the Revolution burst out, and very rashly, said her
father, made her way back into Russia at a time when thousands
were in flight from the Red Terror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dressed as a peasant girl, she had come back to Moscow
on a troop train crowded with Red soldiers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was for love of us,” said her mother, stretching out
her hand and touching the girl’s arm. “God will reward
her. We should have died without her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was my duty, little mother,” said Nadia, bending
down and kissing her mother’s forehead. “Not for a second
have I regretted coming back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In spite of all our misery!” said the old gentleman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nadia turned to Bertram with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father and mother make too much of my coming
back. Even without them I should have returned. I am
a Russian. This is my country. With the Russian people
I suffer, and if need be, die. I am sure all English people
would do the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram thought of the Countess Lydia and her sister,
and of all the Russian émigrés in London and Paris, living
in luxury, dancing, gambling. Not doing much on behalf
of their own folk, except in support of counter-revolutions
and invasions, plots and intrigues for the overthrow of the
Bolshevik régime, which had only increased the ruin and
agony of the Russian people, and intensified the Terror.
He marvelled at this girl who had come back into the midst
of that Terror when the others had all been escaping across
the frontiers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her now, as she heated the samovar, in a
shabby frock, in boots that would have been slung over a
garden wall by any English tramp, yet moving with elegance
and a natural grace. She had taken off her fur cap
and jacket. Her black hair, falling in a loop about her
ears, framed her white face like a Helleu etching. She had
very “liquid” eyes, with long dark lashes, and a broad forehead,
like most Russian women, but with sharper cheekbones
than the Slav type, and thin red lips. About twenty-five,
he guessed, and delicate from what the Germans called
<span class='it'>unternährung</span>—semi-starvation. She was aware of his eyes
upon her, perhaps read the admiration in them, and a faint
blush crept under her skin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long did you remain a prisoner, sir?” asked
Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man raised his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two terrible years. I did not wash all that time or
get a change of linen. It was worse than death. I used
to smile when the <span class='it'>Cheka</span> examined me, and other prisoners
wept before I left the cell, because they thought I was to
be taken out and shot. ‘In the next world,’ I used to say,
‘I shall not need a change of linen.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think they pitied my husband,” said Princess Alexandra.
“He had been a Liberal always, and very generous
to the poor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was a friend of Tolstoy,” said the old man. “I corresponded
with Kropotkin. I was even a little of a revolutionary,
believing in the need of liberty in Russia. Alas,
the Revolution has killed all the liberty we had, and the
tyranny of Lenin is worse than that of Ivan the Terrible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke the words in a whisper, leaning towards Bertram,
with his hand to his mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nadia handed Bertram a cup of tea, and then sat on a
stool by his side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father has abandoned all hope for Russia,” she said.
“That is natural, after so much suffering. But because I
am young, I still believe that out of all this agony some
good will come. Russia has been purged by fire. There
was great corruption in the time of the Emperor. The
Court was very vicious—you have said so many times,
father!—and young people of the rich class were lazy and
luxurious. Not one of them did any kind of work. From
babyhood they were petted and spoilt. They thought of
nothing but gaiety and sensuality. Now we younger people
who stayed in Russia have learnt to work, and to weep.
We have been hungry with the people. We have made our
hands as coarse as theirs. We shall be all the better for
it, perhaps, and help to build a New Russia on nobler lines,
some day. Do you not think so, darling mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old lady’s eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I belong to the Past. All my memories are there. I
dare not look forward to the future—My poor Russia!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our poor Russia!” echoed her husband. “In the hands
of those who are murdering the very souls of our people
by their evil propaganda.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nadia spoke again, very gently, to avoid any hurt to her
father and mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The soul of our people will never die. It is a great,
simple, and generous soul, as I know now by working
among the peasants. Presently this régime will change.
It is already changing. It will become moderate. Russia
will get new liberties. There will be a greater happiness
than before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suvaroff shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Russia is famine-stricken and diseased. For the sins
of those who rule us, and for our own sins in the past, we
shall perish as a civilisation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never!” said Nadia, bravely. “Russia will live with
greater glory, more enlightened, with a people worthy of
great liberties. It is my faith. Without that I should die.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a moment’s silence, as heavy footsteps strode
down the stone corridor, and suddenly the curtain was
drawn back. A young man stood there, in the uniform of
the Red Army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a second or two Bertram was startled and afraid.
There flashed into his mind the thought that perhaps his
visit here had led to trouble for this little family of the old
régime. He was relieved when the old lady smiled and
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My son! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Come in, Alexis. We have an English
visitor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man saluted, and then shook hands with Bertram,
and spoke in perfectly accurate English.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Delighted to meet you, sir. My father and mother told
me they had asked for the honour of a visit from you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat on the edge of his sister’s stool and put his arm
round her waist affectionately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Nadia!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old lady seemed to read the thought passing through
Bertram’s mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are surprised that we have a son in the Red Army?
It is either that or death for our young men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy, Alexis—he seemed a year or two younger than
Nadia—looked down at his uniform with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not only fear of death that makes me wear these
clothes. I’m a Russian. I help to defend my soil from all
invaders. Does not honour and a decent code of patriotism
require that, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He asked the question of Bertram, who did not answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We think,” said Prince Alexander Suvaroff slowly, and
with a touch of embarrassment, “that England, and other
countries, made a mistake in supporting the attacks of men
like Wrangel and Denikin. Bad as the Bolsheviks are, as
God knows, the leaders of the White Armies were, perhaps,
equally corrupt. My son expresses the thought of the
younger generation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is mine, certainly,” said Nadia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The son only stayed a few minutes. He had just called
in to have the pleasure of meeting the Englishman, and to
kiss his father and mother. Soon after his going, Bertram
rose to take his leave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you will never find your way back!” cried Princess
Alexandra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will guide him to the Arbat,” said her daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of Bertram’s protests, she put on her fur cap and
coat again, and waited while he said good night to her
father and mother. The old man rose again from his
packing-case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you would call upon us now and then, it would be
a charity, sir. We know nothing of the outer world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With pleasure!” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He kissed the old lady’s hand again, and at this sign of
regard and sympathy her eyes moistened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have seen the old régime in their poor hovels,” she
said. “The others are like us or worse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have seen their courage,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many of my friends have starved to death,” said the
Princess. “It is Nadia and Alexis who have saved us. My
daughter is a medical student. They still get rations, and
she brings home most of them to us. Without that we
should not be alive.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Come again, dear sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But not in the daylight,” said the old man, with a hint
of fear. “My name is still a cause of suspicion and
dislike.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out into the snow again Bertram walked with Nadia.
Once she stumbled over a snow-drift in the courtyard, and
Bertram said, “Take my arm, won’t you? It’s safer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laid her hand on his arm, and said, “You are very
kind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I marvel at your courage,” he said, presently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She answered with a kind of surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Without courage, what is life? I am young. It is only
the old who are afraid of new adventures.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She told him about her medical studies at the University
of Moscow. All the classes were at night, because the students
worked during the day to supplement their rations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You take yours home,” he said. “How do you manage
to get enough to eat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A very little does for me,” she said. “I am strong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had finished her studies now, and was fully qualified.
Her ambition was to go to the famine district and join the
medical staff at Kazan who were fighting the typhus. They
had asked for her, but it was difficult to travel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How will your father and mother manage without you?”
he asked, and she told him that Alexis had just been promoted
to the Red Army Staff. He would be able to get
better food for them, and protect them, because of his
service to the state.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to Kazan,” said Bertram. “Why not come
in the same train, if I can help you? The Americans are
running it, and they would welcome your help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was excited by the possibility, and begged him to
speak a word for her; and then, believing she had asked
too much of him, pleaded for forgiveness for putting him
to so much trouble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is my eagerness to do some work for Russia which
makes me forget my manners,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put aside the idea of trouble, and had only one doubt
in trying to get her a place in the train to Kazan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They tell me typhus is a scourge there, and very dangerous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” said the girl. “But you are going, are you
not? You are not afraid, because you also want to be of
service to our poor people. Why, then, should I who am
a Russian, be afraid to go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found no answer to that, but thought only of her
devotion to her people and her unselfishness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said something about “self-sacrifice,” and she answered
by words that he afterwards remembered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the only way of happiness, don’t you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” he said, “I’m an egoist.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She refused to believe that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have come out here to help poor Russia. Even at
the risk of your life. That is not egoism.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mixed with egoism,” he said. “To acquire knowledge
for myself. To kill boredom. To heal what I’m pleased
to call a broken heart! Infernal selfishness—all that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have a broken heart?” she asked, with great surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The snow was falling on them at the corner of the Arbat
where they stood, and they both wore white crowns and
mantles, but paid no heed to it, because of this talk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I call it that in a romantic, sentimentalising way. My
wife ran away from me not long ago. It hurt damnably.
Wounded pride, perhaps. One never knows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry,” she said gravely. “You loved her very
much?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enormously, for a time. I was very young.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed uneasily. The old wound still hurt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Love is difficult,” she said. “So it seems, from novels
I have read, and people I have met. I have had no experience
myself.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hunger, poverty, and terror do not seem to encourage
the love instinct, except in a brutal way. Anyhow, it has
left me alone. It is no doubt a pleasant thing. Something
one ought not to miss in life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spoke without any embarrassment or self-consciousness,
but as a child, simply, before the mysteries of life.
Yet she was not a child, but a woman who had lived
through bloody Revolution and great brutalities. Her simplicity
in regard to love was not through ignorance, but
inexperience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should be glad to love you,” she said, “if it would help
your broken heart at all. It would be very nice for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She made this astonishing offer with the same simplicity
and sincerity. It was as though she offered to bind up some
wound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The snow was heavy upon them, and in whirling flakes
around them. He could hardly see her face or figure.
They were alone in a world of whiteness in the ruin of
Moscow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s good of you,” he said. “I shall be glad of your
comradeship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the same thing,” she said. “Comradeship—love—service
together—understanding. That would be good to
have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The best things in life,” said Bertram. “The only things
worth living for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think so too? Well, then it is a promise between
us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A hope,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She told him she must be going back, and held out her
gloved hand. It was wet with the snow, when he put it to
his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are very kind,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned from him, and in a moment was lost to him
in the whirl of snowflakes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Extraordinary!” said Bertram to himself, aloud, as he
groped his way across the Arbat Square in the direction of
the Kremlin’s great walls. He felt less lonely, though he
was alone in Moscow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the same thing,” she had said, “comradeship—love—service
together—understanding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Comradeship. Well, even without love, it would be good.
He needed it enormously, from a woman, as well as from
Christy. Why from a woman? Why had Janet Welford’s
comradeship been so much better than any man’s? Perhaps
women understood better, with more tenderness for
the weakness of men. Or was it just the lure of sex?
Impossible to tell. Why bother to find out? Why not
accept life without analysis, as simply as Nadia’s offer of
love? It was the second time he had been offered woman’s
love since Joyce had gone from him. The pretty German
girl had wanted to go with him, and he had laughed at her,
and played the prig. Was he always to refuse the chance
of human affection, woman’s tenderness, his spiritual and
physical hunger for such companionship? A voice whispered
in his ear, “Loyalty to Joyce! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Loyalty! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Loyalty!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he said, answering this call of conscience, “I’ve
been loyal long enough, by God! And now I’m absolved.”</p>

<div><h1>LV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>He invited Nadia to dinner one night in the little restaurant
in the Arbat, and she accepted with the permission
of her mother and father, who saw no harm in it,
but only a little danger from secret police.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nadia laughed at that peril. She was under the protection
of “Ara,” she said, and the <span class='it'>Cheka</span> could not touch her.
That was true. Bertram had taken Dr. Weekes to the
gipsy-like room in which Prince Alexander lived with his
family, and he had been shocked by their dire poverty.
He knew their name in Russian history, and their former
palace in Petrograd, now used as a soup-kitchen by the
American Relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A cheery young American of the South, with a slow,
drawling speech and quiet manners, he was a man of delicate
physique who seemed to have worn himself out in
service to a suffering world. He was chief medical officer
of “Ara,” and had devoted himself to the hunger-stricken
and diseased children of Austria, Germany, Poland, and
Armenia since the ending of war. Nadia had lit his eyes
with enthusiasm for her courage. “Some girl,” was his verdict,
and his word was enough to secure her appointment
as interpreter and woman secretary on the “Ara” staff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a heap to do for a girl like that in Kazan,” he
said. “Our boys there are clamouring for interpreters and
secretaries. But I fancy I’ve got a special job for her,
where her medical training will count. We’ll see about that
later, when we get to Kazan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So that part of the programme was fixed. She was to
travel with them to Kazan, with two other ladies selected
by the Colonel for office duty in that city, and she was very
happy at the thought, in spite of the tragic nature of the
adventure ahead. She had the zeal of Dr. Weekes himself
who was restless until he reached the famine district.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My job is with typhus,” he said. “I’ve declared a Holy
War against it. It’s my personal vendetta. Where typhus
is worst, there I go. One day, of course, it’s going to get
me! But that’s the fortune of war, and meanwhile it’s a
good game.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nadia had the same kind of philosophy, it seemed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to help Russia. The best way I can help is to
make use of my medical training where the people suffer
most. There’s a dreadful dearth of doctors, and the poor
peasants are hopelessly ignorant of the most primitive rules
of health. I can teach them, wash them, help them to kill
their lice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the restaurant of the Arbat, Bertram was received
with friendly greetings from the husband and wife, and
Katia. They were amazed and delighted to find Nadia
with him. The elderly man with white hair and a pointed
beard kissed her hand respectfully, as the daughter of
Prince Alexander Suvaroff, but Katia flung her arms round
Nadia’s neck and kissed her on both cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know this English gentleman, then!” cried the lady
of the restaurant. “Doubtless you were old friends in England
before the war!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not old friends,” said Nadia, “but good comrades now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not use that word comrade!” said the lady. “It has
been debased. <span class='it'>Tavarish! tavarish! tavarish!</span> I am sick
of it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In English it is better,” said Nadia. “It has its old
meaning still.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She and Bertram sat at a little table in the corner. Katia
waited on them delightedly, kissing Nadia’s neck, or hair,
or hand, every time she came to the table. And Nadia was
joyful because a white cloth was spread on the table, and
there were cut glasses for their cider, which was the only
drink, and plates without a crack in them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is like a fairy-tale,” she said. “Not for four years
have I sat down with snow-white linen to the board.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram wondered that she could endure so long a time
of squalor, after her life in great mansions, surrounded by
luxury from childhood. Did she not sometimes crave to
escape from it to Paris or London, like so many others?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to see this through,” she told him. “It has been
a great adventure of the soul. Terrible, but educating.
You have been a soldier. You know what our men called
‘the front line spirit?’ I have been in the front line, the
danger zone, and have nothing but contempt for those who
fled to safe places in the war. Except the old and feeble,
and the very young.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great adventure of the soul? Yes, there was something
in that. Life at its bleakest and barest like a Polar
expedition to which men like Shackleton and Scott had
gone so blithely. For him also, this Russian visit was to
be a great adventure of the soul. Perhaps with this girl
who offered him her love! Queer that! It wouldn’t be
bad to “see it through” with her. He had no other call
now, no kind of human tie elsewhere. Why not see it
through in Russia as well as anywhere in the world? It
was cut off from the rest of the world almost as completely
as Robinson Crusoe’s island. A shipwrecked country of
a hundred and fifty million people, with himself among
them!</p>

<p class='pindent'>They talked of the Bolshevik régime. He denounced it
as the greatest tyranny on earth, the most brutal type of
Government ever devised by evil minds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head at that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not quite so bad. They have done some good. They
have taught the people to read and write—millions of them.
They have fed the children first—always.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram was amazed at her tolerance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely you don’t defend these people?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she said, “but I understand them. They have been
cruel, but through fear. They were afraid of counter-revolutions,
plots of every kind. They stamped out their
enemies lest the Revolution should be defeated and Czardom
brought back. So it was in France, under Robespierre,
was it not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This Communism!” said Bertram. “It seems to me an
outrage against human nature. It attempts to crush the
individual instinct which is the strongest thing in life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she answered, “that is true, I am sure. But the
individual must subordinate his instincts to the good of the
Commonwealth. One must not forget that Communism
was killed by the peasants—and alas, they too were greedy
and cruel when they had the only source of wealth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there any hope at all for human nature?” asked
Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him with surprise in her dark eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you doubt it? Oh, surely not! Out of all our ignorance
and agony some knowledge will come for the future
race. You and I are learning. Others will know because
of our endeavours, and our failure, and our love. I am
glad to think that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How wise you are!” he said, without irony. “I am
bewildered by life, and without any certain faith. You
seem so sure!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am Russian,” she said, laughing. “We talk and talk
on abstract ideas. We do nothing worth doing. <span class='it'>Nichevo!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Katia came up again, and sat beside Nadia. A party of
young men came into the restaurant and sat talking quietly,
and drinking coffee. The ex-painter to the Imperial Court
was washing up dishes behind the counter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must learn Russian!” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Katia clapped her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nadia will teach you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>England seemed a million miles away. Joyce was in
another planet. Nadia’s black eyes were very kind to him.</p>

<div><h1>LVI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>It was a six days’ journey to Kazan, and seemed interminable.
The “special train” was not so magnificent
as its name, but exactly similar to the one from Riga—in
discomfort, and in lice. The American Colonel arrived
with a young man acting as a kind of A. D. C., and with
Dr. Weekes, two other young men of the American Relief
Administration, a Russian officer of the Red Army, detailed
as interpreter, the two Russian ladies appointed as secretaries,
and Nadia. Jemmy Hart, the newspaper correspondent,
joined up with Bertram, and two officers of the
<span class='it'>Cheka</span> accompanied the party, nominally as police protection,
but really for political espionage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy came down to the station to say farewell. He
revealed a hint of anxiety about Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t take too many risks, Major.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had an idea that he might not stay much longer in
Moscow. He would leave Russia to Bertram. Probably
their next meeting-place would be Berlin or London.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his casual way he mentioned an exciting item of news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Janet has come out to Berlin. I may go and see her
there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet Welford in Berlin! What was she doing there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Having a look round,” said Christy. “Getting a background
for a new novel.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There’s another reason.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He mentioned the other reason in a “by the way” kind
of tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I asked her to meet me there. Now that my wife’s
dead, there’s no reason of consanguinity, affinity, or spiritual
relationship why these two persons should not be joined
in holy matrimony. If Janet’s willing, which is very
doubtful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, here’s luck!” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke the words heartily, and gripped Christy’s hand,
but, at the back of his brain, as it were, was a sense of
envy. Envy of Christy, his best friend! Inconceivable,
that—and yet there was the thought nagging at him. Janet
had been very kind to him in her rooms at Battersea Park.
She had once made his heart thump by a cry of regret that
they had not met and married before Joyce came along.
What were her words? He remembered them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A pity, Sir Faithful, that you didn’t marry me instead
of Joyce! I understand you better. And you were my first
Dream Knight, in the days when you kissed me in Kensington
Gardens.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He leaned out of the carriage window, and gripped
Christy’s hand again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give my love to Janet. Tell her that I’ve killed self-pity.
She’ll understand!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take care of yourself!” said Christy, and then sloped
away from the Kazansky station, with his pipe in his
mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The journey began, and continued, day after day, with
many halts in the middle of Russian forests and the open
countryside. Snow lay heavily on the branches of fir-trees,
and thick on the ground, so that a traveller’s eyes tired of
the white monotony. Every twenty versts or so they
reached a Russian village, with its low roofed wooden
houses, surrounded by high stockades. Peasants were
shovelling snow to make pathways to their village. They
gathered in the station yards to stare at the train, kept back
from too near approach by soldiers of the Red Army who
looked half frozen and half starved. In many stations were
refugee trains without engines, with snow up to the axle
wheels of their closed trucks, in which families were
densely crowded, lying together all hugger-mugger, for
warmth’s sake. It seemed as though they had been there
for months. There was no apparent prospect of these trains
ever moving. Those who died were buried in pits by the
railway track. Across the flat snow-fields there were here
and there processions of men, women and children, crawling
like ants on the march, black against the whiteness of
their way. They, too, were refugees from Famine—without
much hope ahead, thought Bertram, remembering The
End of the Journey, in Petrograd. He wondered how many
would lie down to die in the snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are wonderful in endurance,” said Nadia, to whom
he put the question, as they stood together in the corridor,
looking out of window. “In every village they pass they
get a bit of bread from those who can ill spare it. So they
live from place to place. Those who are strong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had many talks like this with Nadia in the corridor,
or in her compartment, with the two other ladies, belonging,
like herself, to the old régime, once ladies in waiting
of the Imperial Court. The Colonel of the A. R. A. had
provided food for the party, mostly tinned stuff which Dr.
Weekes and Bertram, appointing themselves cooks, heated
up in enamel saucepans over tins of solid alcohol. It made
the time pass, and was more comforting than cold food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At night, in the darkness of the corridor, Nadia stood by
his side, and sometimes they held hands, like children when
the lights are out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They talked of the mystery of life and death, the chances
of world peace, the future of civilisation. Strange topics
of conversation between a young man and woman! But
travelling through Russia after war and revolution, they
seemed the only subjects worth discussing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weekes joined them, and told stories of his experiences
in Armenia and the Balkans—tragic tales of widespread
famine, disease, death. He, too, balanced the possibilities
of Western civilisation. Disease, unless checked
by international effort, might wipe it out in Central Europe.
It had already made deep tracks in fields of child life.
Another war, anything like the last, would so weaken Europe,
apart from its own massacres, that plague and pestilence
might do more destruction than Attila and his Huns
in the old days of the Roman Empire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You and I,” he said, turning to Nadia with his slow
smile, “are two of the most important people in the world.
We’re disease-killers, apostles of sanitation. But the odds
against us are millions to one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fewer men, the greater share of honour,” said
Nadia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had a surprising knowledge of literature, Russian,
French, and English, and, better than such knowledge, a
keen intelligence and candour of outlook which made her
opinion astonishing for so young a woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Bertram admired her, not for her cleverness of
opinion, but for her spiritual quality and entire absence of
self-consciousness. Delicate as she was, the daughter of
an aristocracy to which physical labour had been abhorrent,
she stooped to dirty work with a sense of beauty in its
labour, and Bertram was horrified to find her swilling down
the filthy lavatories before the rest of the travellers had
stirred from their bunks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For God’s sake,” he said, “leave that to the <span class='it'>provodnik</span>.
It’s his job, not yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a job he neglects,” she said, smiling. “As one of
the medical staff of ‘Ara,’ cleanliness and sanitation are in
my department. The smell from this place is terrible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the more reason for you to avoid it,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the Famine district there will be worse smells and
worse dirt, and lice everywhere. If I wanted to avoid
them, I should not be here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are wonderful!” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A simple Russian woman,” she answered. “Why do you
think me wonderful?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were other people in the train who thought her
wonderful when Bertram told them of that early morning
act. The Colonel and Dr. Weekes were filled with admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By God,” said the Colonel, “if all the Russian people
were like that young woman, this country wouldn’t be
plague-stricken with Bolsheviks and bugs!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At night, in their candle-lit carriage, the Colonel and the
Doctor, and Jemmy Hart, the newspaper man, and the
Colonel’s A. D. C., or “pup,” as Hart called him, played
poker with Russian roubles. They gambled fiercely, raising
the stakes by tens of thousands, with a limit of a hundred
thousand, as though possessed of untold wealth. But at
the end of the long evening’s play, no one had lost or gained
more than a few dollars in American rates of exchange.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During these poker games Bertram went into the dusky
corridor again to stand by Nadia. They were left alone,
for the other two Russian ladies went early to their bunks.
The train crawled slowly, or halted for hours while new
fuel was stacked in the engine. The moon rose and flooded
the white landscape and the snow-capped farmsteads and
the laden boughs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Russia is like a dead body under its white shroud,” said
Nadia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems as lonely as an undiscovered land,” said
Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She asked him to tell her a little of his life, so that she
might know him more. He told her only of the things that
had happened, the war, his marriage, the death of the child,
Digby’s murder in Ireland, his mother’s death, his separation
from Joyce. He was not good at self-analysis, and too
much of an Englishman to attempt it. Yet she seemed to
understand more than he told her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Russia does not hold all the unhappiness of life,” she
said. “You have crowded too much suffering into a few
years. It has wounded your spirit. You feel broken, and
perhaps a little resentful of Fate. So much bad luck after
the strain of war!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not whining,” said Bertram. “Your courage
through more dreadful things rebukes my cowardice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not cowardly,” she told him. “I think you will
be very strong and brave when your wound is healed. You
have the eyes of leadership. One day you will help to lead
your country in thought or action.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed at her, but she was sure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One thing she said in those night talks as the train went
crawling through the white wilderness, gave him a glimpse
of a spiritual passion in her soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hated ugliness, and pain, and dirt. As a child these
things were all hidden from me. As a young girl I was
surrounded with beauty and illusion. Now I want to get
deeper and deeper into the misery of the people. I want
to be with them in their pain and their filth. I want to
share their worst agony. It is to pay back to them by the
suffering of my body and spirit for all the cruelties of my
ancestors. If you will read Russian history, you will find
my father’s name—though not my father—attached to acts
which kept the peasants enslaved, and brutalised them.
The old régime is suffering now for the sins of its fathers.
It is right that we should be punished.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe in that doctrine,” said Bertram. “We
should be punished for our own acts, perhaps—though we
are the children of heredity—but not for the crimes of
those who gave us life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the Law,” she said. “The Greeks knew it. Fate
pursues us. It is in the Christian faith. The sins of the
fathers shall be visited upon the children.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s unfair,” said Bertram. “Damned unfair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas, it is true,” she said. “We must do good for our
children’s sake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had a child who died, as I have told you,” said Bertram.
“Sometimes I’m glad. The world is too cruel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not too cruel for those who have courage,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spoke of her desire to have a child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps, if we love each other, you and I may have a
child, dear sir. That would give me great happiness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram was profoundly moved by those words, spoken
with such simplicity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am a stranger to you,” he said. “You do not know
my weakness and my character.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew you,” she said, “when you looked my way in
the market place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night they clasped hands in the darkness of the
corridor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Russian comrade!” he said to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear friend of Russia and of me,” she answered.</p>

<div><h1>LVII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The city of Kazan was buried in snow, frozen hard,
and glittering on its surface as though strewn with
myriads of diamonds. It was a little Moscow, more Oriental,
less ruined by street fighting, strangely beautiful with
its gilt-domed churches and Russian mansions, and wooden
hovels, all canopied in snow. It had been a rich city before
the Revolution. Many great nobles had had summer houses
here. Its market received the wealth of the Volga and
merchandise from the Far East. A third of its population
was Tartar, and under the Soviet régime it had been made
the capital of a new state called the Tartar Republic, subject
to Moscow, but with a certain independence for local
business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tartar type was striking, in its contrast to the blue-eyed,
yellow-bearded peasants amidst whom they dwelt, and
Bertram, staring at the tall, lean men with Mongolian cheekbones,
leathery skin, and straight black hair, thought of
Ghengis Khan and his hordes of men like this, who had
swept across Europe in the Middle Ages to the very gates
of Vienna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kazan was now on the edge of the famine. Hunger was
creeping about the city itself, though even here there was
meat to be had in the market for those who had money to
buy it. The peasants along the Volga valley were killing
the last of their cows, for lack of fodder, and the flesh was
sent up to Kazan by the last boats that could make the
journey before the Volga froze. After that there would be
no more meat, as now there was no grain, no milk, and but
small stocks of bread and potatoes. Soviet officials were
still getting rations direct from Moscow, but that system
was to be abandoned, except for a favoured few, owing to
the “New Economic Laws” which had been framed mainly
because the means of rationing had broken down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Colonel of the A. R. A. and his party were met at
the station with sleighs by four or five young Americans,
in heavy fur coats and Tartar caps, remarkably cheery, in
spite of the frightful picture they painted of the local conditions.
They had established the first food kitchens in
Kazan, and had pushed out the first relief to the villages
beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the situation?” asked the Colonel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cyrus Sims, a young man looking like a Bolshevik bandit,
until he pulled off his shaggy cap with ear-flaps and revealed
a good American head, typical of Harvard, gave a few preliminary
facts to “put the Colonel wise,” as he called it, before
an interview with the President of the Tartar Republic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The situation, sir? Well, briefly, these people are waiting
for death. They can’t see any escape, except by our
help, which won’t amount to much for some time to come,
as you know. We’ve undertaken to feed fifteen hundred
children within three weeks from now. Sounds good.
There’s a child population in this state of one million seven
hundred thousand, all hungry, and mostly starving. Child
population, you understand, sir! Of course we’re not going
to feed adults. They’ll die. The Volga’s trying to freeze.
Another week or two and no boats can pass. That’ll mean
sleigh transport to the starving villages. We shall want
three thousand five hundred horses to feed those fifteen
hundred babes. And the horses are dropping dead along
the roads. No fodder. Certain supplies have come down
from Moscow by Soviet authority. Potatoes mostly.
They’re rotting on the barges.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, in God’s name?” asked the Colonel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Same reason, sir. Dearth of horses for sleigh transport.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall have to get a move on,” said the Colonel.
“Keep the horses alive. There’s lots of fodder to be had if
we raise Hell.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Are you well billeted?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure,” said the young American, resuming his disguise
as a Bolshevik bandit, and tying the ear-flaps of his Tartar
cap under his chin. “Better come along, Colonel, and get
warm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole party was crowded into sleighs, and set off
in a procession, with a merry jingling of sleigh-bells. Dr.
Weekes and Bertram had Nadia for their fellow traveller,
and the doctor pulled the rug over her and packed the straw
about her feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s as cold as Calgary,” he said, “and that’s the coldest
place I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In Russia,” said Nadia, “our blood is a mixture of fire
and ice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a darned queer mixture,” said the doctor. “Unknown
to chemical science.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the secret of Russian history,” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peasants halted on the foot-walks to stare at the passing
sleighs. Their faces were haggard, and their eyes looked
dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is hunger here,” said Nadia. “In Moscow we
haven’t enough to eat, but here they starve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sleighs halted outside a marble-fronted house with
many windows, and Nadia gave a little cry of surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know this house! It belonged to my father’s brother.
I was here as a child, with my mother and Alexis. My
uncle was the Governor of Kazan, and very kind to me.
They shot him dead in the street one day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram looked at her, and saw how she was stirred with
the remembrance of old days before the agony of Russia
had touched her life. For a moment her dark eyes filled
with tears, but when she stepped down from the sledge,
taking his hand to help her, she spoke brave words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How lucky I am to be with those who have come to
rescue Russia!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were log fires burning in all the rooms of the
house, and little camp beds in most of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good billet,” said the Colonel. “You boys know how
to grab at luxury.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much luxury, sir, and plenty of bugs,” said the
young man named Sims, who was in command of the
“outfit” at Kazan. “This place was used for refugees, until
we came. It’s still a menagerie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Work for me,” said Dr. Weekes. “I’m the world’s light-weight
vermin-killer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Russian ladies were invited to lunch, but a special
billet had been arranged for them in a house near by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good scheme,” said the Colonel. “We don’t want any
scandals for the Hearst Press. And I can see you boys have
already fallen in love with my Princess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s a peach,” said one of them. “But we’re too busy
for amorous dalliance, Colonel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Colonel winked at Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see the virtue of the A. R. A.? Marvellous, don’t
you think? Almost incredible!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps his cold clear eyes had perceived the comradeship
of Bertram and “his” princess. If so, he was discreet,
and made no personal remarks, and it was by his suggestion
that Nadia was asked to go with Bertram and Dr. Weekes
to inspect the hospitals and homes for abandoned children
in Kazan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d better take the Princess with you, Doctor. I’ve
faith in a woman’s eyes, and anyhow, I’m going to put her
in charge of the local committee for child-feeding, so she
must get about and see things. You’d like to join them,
Pollard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Nadia who acted as interpreter, and it was by
her side, getting courage from her, that Bertram went into
places which made him cry out to God in his heart, and
filled him with horror, and turned his stomach so that he
could hardly prevent himself from vomiting, as he had done
in the barrack yard at Petrograd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The children’s homes seemed worst of all. In the first of
them were fifteen hundred who had been abandoned by their
parents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why abandoned?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nadia bent down to one child, a girl of twelve or so,
stark naked, and so emaciated that all her ribs were visible
beneath the tight-drawn skin. Word by word she translated
the child’s monologue, told with the gravity of an old
woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She says her father belonged to Lubimovka. Once his
barns were filled with grain and he had twenty cows. When
the drought came, the standing wheat was burnt black in
the fields. Red soldiers came and took the grain from the
barn, all but a very little. Then the cows died, one by one.
There was no food in the house. This little one had six
brothers and sisters. Three of them died, because they had
no food. The mother wept very much when they died.
The father did not weep, until one day he took his children
for a long, long walk away from Lubimovka to the town
of Tetiushi. Then he said, ‘Wait here a little while, my
children. Perhaps God will send his angels with food for
you.’ And then he wept, and walked away. They waited
a long while, and he did not come back. And God did not
come with His angels. So they lay down to die. It was
little Anna that died. The two others were fed by the
market people in Tetiushi, and then put on a train that
came to Kazan. So they were brought to this house, with
many other children who were like themselves. They had
bread once a day, and potato soup. They would be glad
to have some clothes, because it is very cold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nadia turned to Bertram, and her eyes were shining with
tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This little one knows why her father abandoned her.
It was because he loved her, and could not bear to hear her
crying out for food when there was nothing in the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why are these children naked?” asked Bertram. “They
will perish of cold in this house. It’s an ice-well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nadia spoke to a sad-eyed man in a linen coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He says it is the only way of keeping down typhus.
When the children come in their clothes are crawling with
vermin. He takes off their clothes and burns them. But
there are no means of replacing them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely they could make fires in the house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nadia shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is impossible to get fuel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are great woods around Kazan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no means of transport for the timber.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Men could haul it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The men are weak, he says, and despair makes them
lazy. And anyhow, he could not pay for their labour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They walked through room after room, all crowded with
children. Their heads had been shaved, and in their nakedness
they lay huddled close together, so thin, with such
deep-sunk eyes, that they were unlike children of the
human race, but like a tribe of white monkeys, clinging to
each other for warmth in a frozen world. They did not
play, or chatter, or laugh. They were utterly silent, with
drooping heads, and a terrible old sadness in their little
sunken eyes. Because there was no fuel, there was no hot
water, and because there was no hot water, there was no
cleanliness. A frightful stench pervaded the rooms. Some
of the children lay in filth.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow I shall come here and do some work,” said
Nadia. “The good man means well, but he has no energy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weekes made some notes in a little book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blankets. Clothes. Soap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He whispered a warning to Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t brush against the door-posts as you pass. They’re
alive with vermin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They passed into another room, where there was row
after row of children lying on the bare boards, in a kind
of feverish sleep, with their heads flopping from side to
side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Typhus,” said Nadia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the children was a girl of about twenty, in a
cotton frock. She lay amidst a group of them, with one
arm over their naked bodies, sleeping, with a flame of
colour on her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nadia spoke to the man in the linen coat, and then turned
to Bertram and Dr. Weekes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the Countess Narishkin. She was a nurse here.
Yesterday she developed the typhus fever. There is no
kind of hope for the poor child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She knelt down on the bare boards, and put one arm
under the girl’s head and raised it a little, smoothing her
hair back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Princess,” said Dr. Weekes, sternly, “you know enough
about typhus to avoid unnecessary risks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is true,” said Nadia. “For the sake of others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose from her kneeling position, laying the girl’s head
very gently on the boards again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have some medicine,” said the young doctor, “I will
give her an injection this afternoon. But I’m afraid—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at Nadia, and she said “Yes,” understanding
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That afternoon, using their sleigh, they went to twelve
such homes for abandoned children, and in each of them
were the same scenes of stricken childhood, and in each
of them the same amount of fever, of vermin, of filth, and
of stench.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God!” said Bertram, at last, “It’s too awful. Can you
bear to see any more, Nadia?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put her hand on his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is only the beginning of the things we shall see. It
makes you suffer, dear comrade! That is good. You will
write such pictures that the world will be moved to tears
and charity. They will forgive the sins of Russia because
of all this agony. By your words of truth and pity you
will help to save those little ones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll try,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a dedication.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the great hospital of Kazan, once famous in the history
of medical science, they plunged deeper into human
misery. It was crowded with men and women suffering
from every kind of disease, but mostly from typhus and
dysentery caused by vermin and hunger and weakness.
Whatever their disease, the patients lay huddled together,
not on beds, for they had been burnt for fuel, but on the
bare boards. They had a few blankets, but not many,
which covered four at a time, two lying one way and two
the other. There was no heat in the stoves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weekes questioned the chief medical officer, who
looked in a dying condition, utterly pallid, and with hardly
the strength to walk about his wards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you any drugs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very few!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any anæsthetics—chloroform—morphia?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any castor-oil?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A tiny drop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And disinfectants?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any soap?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not for two years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any bandages, cotton wool, surgical dressings?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My God!” said Dr. Weekes, and it was the first word
of dismay that escaped his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In ward after ward they saw the huddled victims of
pestilence and famine. Their clothes had not been burnt,
like those in the children’s homes, and they were hunting
vermin ceaselessly in their sheepskins and rags. It was
difficult to give a guess at the age or class of these people.
Young girls looked like old women. Young men had the
worn, wrinkled look of extreme age. They were all reduced
to a dead level of misery and squalor, and dirt;
though among them, said Nadia, who spoke with many,
were women of education and even of learning. She went
about among the beds. Some of the women lying on the
boards, raised themselves a little and kissed her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A strange scene happened downstairs, as they were leaving.
The news had gone round among the nurses that an
officer of “Ara” had come to inspect the hospital, with
means of help. Twenty of them suddenly came clamouring
round Dr. Weekes, all crying together, all stretching
out their hands to him, like a Greek chorus, with burning
eyes in white faces. It was almost dark in the passage
there, and Bertram was alarmed by those women’s eyes and
by the almost savage anguish of their voices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do they say?” asked Dr. Weekes, turning to
Nadia. “What’s their trouble, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They say they are starving. They implore you to send
them bread. How can they nurse the sick, they say, when
they are so weak and famished? Only last week two of
them died of dysentery, caused by hunger. Soon they will
all be dead, they say, unless they get some food.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell them,” said Dr. Weekes, “that the A. R. A. will
send them food, though we are here only to feed the children
of Russia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned to Bertram with troubled eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think the Colonel will stand for that pledge. We
can’t let these women starve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Nadia who translated the promise to them, and
as though she were the Lady Bountiful who had been the
means of rescue, they pressed round her, kissing her hands
and her dress, until she laughed and protested, and pointed
to the doctor as their champion. He hurried out with deep
embarrassment, because one of them seized his hands and
tried to kiss them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night, as a strange contrast to those scenes, Bertram
went to the opera of Kazan with the Colonel and his little
crowd. They were playing Boris Goudonoff to a crowded
house of young Russians, who were warmly clad, and, in
appearance, well fed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is it possible that these people have enough to eat,
and enjoy themselves,” asked the Colonel, “while millions
are starving all around?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They enjoy themselves,” said Cyrus Sims, “but they’re
all hungry. There’s not a single man or woman here
that’s had enough to eat to-day. But they come to the
opera as the one little gleam of light and joy and colour in
the monotony of misery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot believe it,” said the Colonel. “Those people
aren’t hungry. I guess they’re Soviet officials who have
hoarded up secret stores.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some of them, perhaps. But there’s not much chance
of that. They’ve been rationed as Soviet workers until a
week ago. Now the rations are cut off, and they’re tightening
their belts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a new <span class='it'>bourgeoisie</span>,” said the Colonel. “The Bolsheviks
declared war on the old <span class='it'>bourgeoisie</span>, and then set
up a new one of their own. There’s no more equality in
Soviet Russia than there is in the United States.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram agreed with him, but that night he had to admit,
after an amazing invasion of the A. R. A., that the glamour
and glitter of the opera only concealed the sharp tooth of
hunger. It showed itself naked and unashamed when the
door was opened to a ringing of bells and a party of opera
singers desired to know if they might invite themselves to
supper with <span class='it'>Messieurs les Américains</span>?</p>

<p class='pindent'>How could a party of young Americans, six thousand
miles from home, refuse to share their bully beef with art
in distress?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come right in!” said Sims, in command of “the bunch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They came right in, six ladies and three men, including
the Prima Donna, who was a Persian lady, with a wonderful
voice, enormous black eyes, and a ferocious appetite.
The American boys brought out their tinned beef and biscuits,
their cheese and butter, and made a picnic meal with
hot cocoa. The Russian ladies of the opera, speaking but
a few words of French and German, which was their only
conversational link with their American hosts who had
picked up a smattering of those languages, after two years
in Europe, made no concealment of their delight in the
presence of this food. They fell upon it like harpies, and
it was the beautiful Persian girl who devoured the last of
a Dutch cheese with her big black eyes raised in ecstasy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the Americans produced a gramophone, and
turned on a jazz tune, and initiated the Persian lady into
the mysteries of the fox-trot, while she screamed with
laughter. The others, still roving round for stray biscuits,
laughed up and down the scale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram slipped away to his camp bed in a little salon
which had once been the writing-room of Nadia’s uncle,
Governor of Kazan in Imperial Russia. Those dancers in
the next room were like the merry ladies of the Decameron,
surrounded by plague.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked out of his window to the white night, with a
moon above the snow. It was very quiet in Kazan, with
its houses filled with naked children, and starving people,
where typhus prevailed.</p>

<div><h1>LVIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>In the house where Nadia was lodged with the two other
Russian ladies, Bertram was able to have some private
talk with her before taking the boat next morning down
the Volga.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve come to say good-bye,” he said. “For a few weeks
at least. Afterwards—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked up at him with a smile, as she sat sewing at
a table. She was making herself a linen coat such as doctors
wear in the wards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Afterwards, my friend—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was silent for a little while, thinking deeply of many
things—of all his life, and the meaning of it, and the hope
of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps it’s too soon to talk of afterwards. When I
come back we will arrange something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What kind of thing?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our life together,” he said simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose, and let her linen drop, and took his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will be your good comrade,” she said. “For a little
while, if you like. For ever, if you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want comradeship,” he told her. “I’m lonely, and I
hate loneliness. I think we could do good work together,
for children, for peace, for ourselves. I’ll be a faithful
servant to you, Princess!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not mine,” she said, smiling. “I’m no Princess, but a
serving wench. I’m Communist enough to believe in
equality between a man and his woman. We will serve God
together!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know much about God,” said Bertram. “I’m
a hopeless infidel. But I’m spiritual enough to adore the
goodness in you. Your courage! Your self-forgetfulness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where love is, there God is also,” said Nadia. “That’s
Tolstoy, but it’s true, I think. We will find God together,
in love for each other and the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve made a hopeless failure of love once,” said Bertram.
“I’d be glad to get a second chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall have the chance, dear sir,” said Nadia. “You
are one of the great lovers of the world. How proud I
am to be your handmaid! I will help you to do your work
for poor humanity. Every word you write shall be a light
to my love for you. You will make the world know the
truth, and I shall have a share in it by keeping you well,
giving you comfort in spirit and body, making for you that
little private paradise of which once you spoke to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You promise me good things,” said Bertram. “Better
than most men get, and more than I deserve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I promise myself better things,” she answered. “I am
selfish in thinking of so many sweet gifts that will come to
me with you. Happiness in Russia! I think I shall be the
only happy woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You make me a little afraid,” said Bertram. “You will
find me out as a poor fellow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I have found you out as a kind, brave gentleman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something happened to us in the market-place at Moscow!”
said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was God’s hand that turned your head my way and
let me look into your eyes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was luck,” he said. “God, if you like!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Love, anyhow,” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood looking into her eyes, and his were thoughtful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My love,” he said, “is not a boy’s first flame of passion,
body and soul on fire. That was given to my wife, Joyce.
In a way it’s hers now, because it belongs to the past which
was hers and mine. I shall come to you in a different way,
Princess. Not as an ardent boy, but as a man who’s seen
the brutality of life, and come through agony, and perhaps
has a better understanding of himself and of human nature.
But what love I have in my heart, and a comradeship
of utter loyalty, devotion, and humility, shall be yours
until I die, if you’ll let me live with you so long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall arrange our life together,” she said, using the
words he had spoken. “Our loving comradeship has no ignorance.
We have both seen life’s misery and been touched
by it. We shall have the wisdom of love, so that it is more
precious.”</p>

<div><h1>LIX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The boat was the last to leave Kazan to go down the
Volga. There was already ice in the river, and the
wooden piers were being pulled in. The Russian skipper
was anxious to get back on the return journey, lest the
boat should be ice-bound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not a bad boat. There was room on board for
three hundred passengers, and many little cabins in the
first class. In the old days it had been a pleasure-steamer
for Russian gentry, and the well-to-do <span class='it'>bourgeoisie</span>, when
the summer shone upon the broad waters of the Volga.
There had been wine parties on summer nights in the
panelled saloon, and under the awnings on the promenade
decks. Gipsies had sung the Volga song and their own
weird melodies to Russian aristocrats with their pretty mistresses,
in this ship of pleasure. Now all its paint had
gone, and its decks were dirty, and its cabins foul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Incredible filth was in the cabins. Bertram and Dr.
Weekes made a brief inspection of them and then beat a
hasty retreat. Insects of every species crawled up the
panels, swarmed in disgusting orgies under the mattresses,
made dwelling-places in the very wash-basins. For months,
according to the skipper, this had been a refugee ship, transporting
thousands of people escaping from the famine.
On every voyage dozens of dead bodies had been thrown
overboard. Typhus had raged in the ship. Specimens of
all the vermin of Southern Russia had mingled in this floating
menagerie, and bred and multiplied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weekes was frankly scared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A death-ship!” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, with generous courage, he gave Bertram the only
clean place for a sleeping berth. It was the table in the
dining saloon, which seemed to be free from vermin.
Bertram refused the privilege, and would not accept until
the young doctor shared its table space. Jemmy Hart, the
newspaper correspondent, was with them. He cursed Russia,
Bolshevism, and bugs with untiring eloquence, and with
rich imaginative efforts. They brought with them sufficient
tinned food, it seemed to Bertram, to provide a battalion
with two months’ rations, but before the return journey
they were on half rations and hungry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hungry, though for a time Bertram lost his appetite and
never wanted to eat another mouthful of food again until
he died. How could he sit down to a meal of pork and
beans, good white bread, and American cheese, after days
among people who had but a handful of grass between them
and death, who watched their children die, one by one, and
lay down themselves to die, with nothing of any kind to
eat, though they had garnered filth and eaten that until it
was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a day and a night the boat steamed slowly down
stream, between the low-lying banks of the Volga, rising
steeper as they travelled south. On each side of them was
a white desolation, immense, monotonous, unbroken, except
now and then where distant villages lay buried in
snow. No smoke came from them. No peasants came
down to the landing-stages. No sign of human life appeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a great white death,” said Dr. Weekes in a low
voice. His fur cap and heavy astrachan collar were covered
with snow as he stared from the bridge across the countryside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better dead than alive in this country,” said Jemmy
Hart. “That Bolshevik vermin made a merry game of me
last night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They tied up at Tetuishi, and went across the landing-stage,
up steep snow banks to a little town perched on a
hill. A few Tartars wandered about the market place,
gaunt and shaggy. There were lines of booths, like those
in Kazan and Moscow, but there were no soldiers and no
buyers, and no merchandise. From a Red soldier sitting
inside a sentry-box, with his rifle between his knees, blue-lipped
and blue-nosed, and as starved-looking as a stray
dog, they found out the whereabouts of the President of
the Tetuishi Commune. It was Jemmy Hart who acted as
interpreter, having learnt Russian in its prisons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The President was a dark, liquid-eyed man, with shaggy
black hair. Sitting behind him, in his office, were three or
four other men of the Soviet Committee, with moody,
melancholy eyes. They looked like respectable mechanics
at a Baptist meeting, and not like “the bloody Bolsheviks,”
as Jemmy Hart called them in their presence, relying on
their ignorance of English with an American accent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jemmy asked for sleighs and horses—<span class='it'>seichas</span>! Immediately.
He spoke in the name of the A. R. A., to which
they bowed their heads, as at the name of God. Certainly.
They would have a sleigh and two horses—<span class='it'>seichas</span>. It was
four hours before they arrived, and during that time, between
Jemmy’s explosions of impotent wrath, the President
of Tetuishi imparted information regarding his district.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had been a rich granary before the droughts of 1920
and 1921. It had exported a surplus of two million poods
of grain. Now the last harvest had only given sixteen hundred
poods of grain. The people had very little to eat. In
some villages nothing to eat. They were dying in great
numbers at Spassk, and in other places to which he pointed
on a map which hung behind his desk. The Soviet Government
had sent down some barge-loads of potatoes. Owing
to the lack of horses it was difficult to transport them to
distant villages. It was a great tragedy. Many poor people
were doomed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke in a quiet, kind, melancholy voice, not
agonising, not pleading for help, but accepting on behalf of
his people an inevitability of death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The horses came at last, and with Dr. Weekes and Jemmy
Hart, Bertram drove across the snow-fields to the nearest
villages. The Tartar driver shouted to his lean nags and
they went at a great pace over the hard snow, through a
frosty wind which slashed Bertram’s face like a whip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They halted outside the high stockade which surrounds
all Russian villages, to keep in the cattle and keep out the
wolves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s walk in and see the best and the worst,” said Dr.
Weekes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A broad roadway divided the village into two. On each
side were neat houses of unplaned logs, squarely built,
under sloping roofs, heavily laden with snow. Steeply the
snow was banked up all round them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not a soul stirred in the village. From one end to the
other, there was no sign of life. No dog barked. No cattle
stood in the yards or sheds. There was no crowing of
cocks or clucking of chickens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is everybody dead?” asked Dr. Weekes, and his voice
was startling in the melancholy silence of the place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Bertram, “I have seen faces at the windows,
but hardly human.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glanced at the window of a cottage close by, and Dr.
Weekes looked in that direction. Three little faces were
staring out at them, gravely. They were like monkey faces.
They were like the faces of the abandoned children in
Kazan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s go in,” said Dr. Weekes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knocked at a cottage door, and after a moment or two
it was opened, and on the threshold stood a tall peasant,
with a flaxen beard and blue eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jemmy Hart spoke to him in Russian, and he bowed, and
made a gesture, with simple dignity, inviting them to go in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room into which they went was spotlessly clean, and
newly scrubbed by a woman who stood shyly on one side
and then crossed herself, in the Russian fashion when
strangers pass the threshold. The three children who had
stared out of the window came and clung to her skirts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jemmy Hart talked to the man, and then turned to the
others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He says they are starving, like all the others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ask them if they have any food at all,” said Dr.
Weekes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man says ‘some dried leaves.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman went to a cupboard, and brought out a small
wooden bowl, in which was some fine, brownish powder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She showed it to Bertram, and then began to weep very
quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is all they have,” said Jemmy Hart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What will happen when that is gone?” asked Dr.
Weekes. “Have they any hope of getting food from the
local Soviet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He says there is no hope, because there is no food.
They are waiting, he says, for death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weekes took one of the children in his arms, and felt
its body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It won’t be long, I guess,” he said very quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man says he will take us to see some of his neighbours,”
said Jemmy Hart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went with him into another cottage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An old woman was there, with a child in her arms. She
lifted up a cloth around its body, and showed a little skeleton
figure, with a strangely distended stomach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Starvation,” said Dr. Weekes. “They swell out like
that in the last stage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old woman talked with passionate grief, to which
Jemmy Hart listened with his head bent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She says this child belongs to her son. His wife died
a week ago, of dysentery. There was no more food in the
house. He walked away into the snow, and has not come
back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A group of women gathered in the farm-yard next to
this old woman’s cottages. In some way they had learnt
that strangers had come—perhaps with rescue. They
pressed round Bertram, plucking at his coat, crying out to
him, weeping, yet with a kind of anger, as though fierce
with despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of them brought out a bowl filled with bits of
black stone, as it seemed, or lead. She took out a bit of it,
and flung it on the ground, and then raised both arms to
heaven and gave a loud wailing cry. The other women
spoke to Jemmy Hart, and seemed to explain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s clay,” said Jemmy. “They dig it out of a hill called
Bitarjisk. It’s sold for five hundred roubles a pood. They
powder it up and mix it with water and swallow it. It has
some nutritive quality, I guess, but these women say it
bursts the bowels of their little ones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tall peasant who was their guide, elbowed his way
through the women who clung to Bertram and his companions
with shrill cries. He led them to another cottage,
and bade the women stay outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inside it was very quiet and cold. For a moment there
was no sign of any life here. But from a pile of rags on a
wooden bench against one of the walls, a man rose to a
half-sitting posture. He was nearly naked, with but a
tattered shirt over his body. His chest was bare, and
showed deep hollows below the bones of the neck, and his
arms were like withered sticks, and his legs had no flesh
on their bones, but only a scabby skin. He was bleeding
from the mouth, and there were bloody rims round his eyes.
He seemed to Bertram like Lazarus risen from the
tomb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were other living people in the room. Bertram
heard a faint stir above the stove where, on the shelf above,
Russians sleep in winter. A woman lay there with a little
girl. They raised their heads feebly, and let them drop
again. They were nearly dead, it seemed. At the far end
of the room, on the window seat, with his head back against
the framework, was a young lad—eighteen, perhaps—with
a fair, handsome face, and blue eyes. He did not move
his body, or alter the position of his head, but his eyes
stared at the strangers in his father’s house. He was still
alive, but too weak to raise a hand or stir a limb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jemmy Hart bent down to the man, and spoke to him.
For a time he was silent, and seemed to have lost the gift
of speech. But presently he spoke some words in a
whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jemmy translated them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He says death has been long in coming. They have been
waiting like this, day after day, and still live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The peasant who had been their guide spoke to Jemmy,
who told the others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This man was rich once. He owned many fields and a
herd of cattle. The drought burnt his harvest up, and all
his cattle died. He sold his clothes for food. He has
nothing in the world. There are many like him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For Christ’s sake,” said Bertram, “give him this!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He handed Jemmy all his money—a great wad of roubles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man stared at it, and muttered something.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does he say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He says money is no good. There’s nothing to buy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The peasant guide spoke again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This man says it’s true,” said Jemmy. “Money is no
good in this village, because there’s nothing to sell, and
nothing to buy. It’s the same in Tetuishi, and that’s the
farthest any one can go without horses. Your money is
just waste paper, old lad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram was pale to the lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there was nothing to be done for these people. No
power on earth could help them. They were waiting for
Death to cross the threshold, as their kindest visitor, and
Death tarried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went into other villages, and it was the same. The
women clamoured about them, believing they had come
from some great power, with rescue, and they had none at
that time, though later they would get food to the children,
or to some of them. Young girls, beautiful as all the
peasant girls in the Volga valley, lay dying in cottages and
barns. Lads on the threshold of youth’s adventure, waited
patiently and quietly for death, with those who were old
enough to die. The children did not even wail in their
hunger, but crawled about the floors with swollen heads
and grave wondering eyes. In some of the barns where
once rich stores of grain had been, now lay unburied
bodies.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t stand much more of this,” said Bertram. “War
is a merry game to famine!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night, on the vermin-haunted ship, he could not eat,
but saved some bread and cheese for people he would meet
on the morrow, in other villages further down the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing but an enormous act of world charity will save
these people,” said Dr. Weekes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid it won’t happen,” said Bertram. “People are
fed up with tragedy. The war deadened them. All the
appeals for devastated Europe—Austria, Hungary, Poland,
Armenia—have led to reaction and boredom. Russia comes
too late in the day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Charity will use its hatred of Bolshevism to close its
heart-springs to the Russian people,” said Dr. Weekes.
“They’ll say, ‘Why in Hell should we help Soviet Russia
to feed its Red Army’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And charity isn’t enough,” said Jemmy Hart. “Not the
private charity of dear old ladies. The nations of the world
must save Russia—and mighty quick, or it will be too late
for the people we saw to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And those we shall see to-morrow,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sat up late in the saloon, on the table, with their
legs up to avoid the crawling things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s going to happen to this sad and bad old Europe?”
asked Jemmy Hart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For hours they discussed his question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weekes had a fine and spiritual outlook on life. He
deplored the attitude of his own country, which he accused
of selfish indifference to humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re betraying Christ,” he said. “We’re the Pharisees
of the world. ‘Thank God that we are not as these men
are—publicans and sinners.’ We’re up to the neck in self-righteousness.
We came into the war a damned sight too
late to suffer the agony of those who fought first and
longest. We cleared out of Europe a damned sight too
quick. Back to Big Business. A hundred-per-cent Americanism.
God! I’m ashamed of my own folk!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jemmy Hart would have none of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re the Tom Tiddler’s ground of all the beggars of
Europe. We fill the hat every time. I guess we’ll stuff
food into Russia, while swearing by all our gods that Europe
can go to hell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Russia is the key of world peace and economic recovery,”
said Dr. Weekes. “These people must be saved, for
our sake as well as theirs. We want them to buy our
goods. We want their grain and oil and minerals and
timber and flour. There won’t always be drought in
Russia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about the Red Army?” asked Jemmy Hart. “As
long as it stands to arms, Poland stays mobilised. As long
as it threatens Poland, France presses Germany for the
last gold mark, because France pays Poland.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Precisely that,” said Dr. Weekes. “The nations must
present an ultimatum to Soviet Russia. ‘We’ll feed your
people, make your trains run, re-start your industries, in
return for certain conditions which we impose. Down with
the Red Army. No propaganda. Recognition of pre-war
debts. That or nothing.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would Lenin accept?” asked Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weekes nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He knows the game’s up. He <span class='it'>must</span> accept to save his
people. But we must act together, or he will drive wedges
between us and play Germany against France.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they talked. But in their silences they thought of the
peasants who were dying in the snow-bound villages beyond
the river banks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Day after day they went down the river, tying up at landing
stages, driving over the snow-fields, going into the land
of Famine, until Bertram said, “I’ve seen enough. The
horror is getting on my nerves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I agree,” said Dr. Weekes. “We have enough to report.
Mine will go to the A. R. A. Yours to the world. With
Jemmy Hart’s. Your opportunity is greater than mine. If
you write the things we have seen, you’ll make men and
angels weep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I write what I feel,” said Bertram, “it will make
them sick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I write what I know,” said Jemmy Hart, “my best
friends will denounce me as a Bolshevist!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in the city of Samara, crowded with refugees,
abandoned children, typhus-stricken families, and starving
peasants, that Bertram wrote the Truth about the Famine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every word he wrote was an appeal to the world for
mercy and pity on behalf of these people. As his pen travelled
over the white pages of his writing blocks, he had
before his eyes the vision of women wailing over their
starving children, of straw-bearded peasants with the agony
of death in their patient eyes, of boys and girls he had seen
lying down to die in each other’s arms. He wrote with a
Biblical simplicity, but Dr. Weekes who read what he wrote,
wept frankly and unashamed, and said, “It’s God’s truth,
Pollard! You’ll make the English-speaking peoples see the
things you have seen, and feel the touch of the pity that’s
in your heart. I envy you your gift of words.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boat was ice-bound at Samara, and it was by train
that Bertram went back with Dr. Weekes to Moscow, with
all his narrative. It was a four days’ journey, and like the
Russian journeys he had made, filthy and fatiguing. During
those four days and nights he thought always in his
waking hours of that lady, Nadia, to whom he was returning
after his work for the people she loved. Through all
this time, indeed, on the Volga and in the villages, her
words were with him, her spiritual comradeship gave him
courage and endurance, the gift of her love lightened even
the darkness of all that horror. He was going back to the
best woman he had ever known, utterly unselfish, “saintly”
in a gay and beautiful way, yet human and gracious as one
of Shakespeare’s women. She would be his companion
along the lonely road. She would keep his courage to the
sticking point. She would be, perhaps, the mother of his
children. The image of Joyce was fading from his mind.
She belonged to a different age, and a different world—a
thousand years ago, a million miles away. He could think
of Joyce now without a pang, without anger, even, and
without jealousy. He was sorry about Kenneth Murless.
It was hard on Joyce that Kenneth had died. Not a bad
chap, after all! A gentleman in the old meaning of the
word. With Nadia as his mate, he could wish Joyce all
happiness. That pretty child! That spoilt darling of an
ancient caste, now passing into history with other ghosts!</p>

<p class='pindent'>With Nadia he would walk in the middle of the road, as
he had tried to walk with Joyce. No longer was he lonely.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>It was the Colonel with his young “puu” who met them
at the station in Moscow. Sims was there too, and some
of the other boys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glad to see you back,” said the Colonel. “It seems an
age since you went. Thought you might have turned Bolsheviks
and gone to rule the Far Eastern Republic!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any news?” asked Dr. Weekes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Colonel pondered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Devilish little. Odd bits. There’s a Treaty of Peace
between England and Ireland.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank God for that,” said Bertram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Upper Silesia has been divided by the League of Nations.
The Germans are howling in agony.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guessed they would,” said Dr. Weekes. “Any local
news?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Colonel pondered again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sims left his heart behind him in Kazan, with that Persian
<span class='it'>prima donna</span>. Sad business!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A libel, sir!” said Sims.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Colonel thought again, and a grave look, not of
mockery, came into his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One tragic thing that makes us all sad. Our Russian
Princess—you remember her?—Nadia—died a week ago.
Typhus. A most devoted and beautiful young lady. I hate
to think of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry,” said Dr. Weekes, in a low voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram said nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He walked alone again.</p>

<div><h1>LX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>He did not stay long in Moscow. He took the train
to Riga, and posted his articles across the Russian
frontier. Then he went on to Berlin, with a “wire” in
advance to Christy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy met him at the station, and not only Christy, but
Janet Welford.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir Faithful!” she cried, using her old nickname for
him. “By my halidom, but I’m glad to see you! After all
this age of time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took his hands, and gave him her cheek to kiss.
Then a grave look came into her eyes, and the merriment
died out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not looking too well. Anything wrong with you,
friend?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A bit chippy, that’s all,” said Bertram. “But enormously
glad to see you again. Have you fixed it up with Christy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She blushed and laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve made a kind of contract, subject to alteration.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took his arm, and spoke gravely again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re ill, my dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s nothing,” he said. “A chill!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was more than a chill. It was typhus. That night
they put him to bed, fever-stricken. The vermin of the
Volga had done their work. Janet Welford sat with him
in a room that Christy had hired, and several times he
spoke her name, without knowing she was near. Once he
spoke another name which she had never heard before.
“Nadia”—it sounded like that. But in his delirium he
talked incessantly of Joyce. The image of the girl who
had been his wife came back to him. They were married
again. All else was blotted out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joyce, darling! How beautiful you are! The ideal
beauty! That was old Christy’s phrase. Joyce! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Joyce.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Is breakfast ready? What a kid you are!
Why, Joyce, sweetheart, aren’t you ready yet? I’ve been
waiting for you. I’m always lonely without you. Even
for a second. Joyce .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Joyce .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Joyce.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet Welford bent over him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked so young in his fever, with flushed cheeks and
tousled hair. A boy again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Loyalty,” he said. “I’m nothing without loyalty, Joyce.
It’s all yours.” He seemed to be arguing with her, trying
to make her understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The middle of the road. That’s where I am. Between
the extremes, Joyce. A damned lonely place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A German doctor came with Christy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is very dangerous,” he said. “This is Russian typhus.
He must be removed to a hospital. In the morning. The
authorities insist on it in cases of infectious fevers. To-night
I will send you a nurse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Janet Welford. “I’m nursing him to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the risk of your own life, <span class='it'>gnädiges Fräulein</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take the risk, doctor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy was anxious, helpless, gloomy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Turn and turn about,” he said. “I’ll take the night
watch, my dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she said again, “this is my work. Lie down till
the morning, and be good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Early in the morning she came out of Bertram’s room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He keeps calling for Joyce. She ought to know. Can
you send her a telegram?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Holme Ottery,” said Christy. “That ought to find her.
But she doesn’t deserve it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No woman deserves such love as his,” said Janet; and
Christy saw that she had tears in her eyes. He knew that
he was only second in her heart, and that Bertram held
first place. She made no secret of it, and spoke frankly
to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love every hair of his head, my dear. You won’t be
angry when I tell you that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not angry,” said Christy, “nor jealous. I have your
friendship, and it’s good enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My friendship for ever,” she said, “and more loyal because
you know about this boy, and understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Need you send for Joyce?” he asked. “Perhaps if he
gets well—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head, and knew what he meant to say, and
did not dare to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. That would be a dirty kind of trick, and I’ve kept
clean, so far. All through the night he has kept calling for
Joyce. She’s still in possession of him, and I’ve no claim.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In London,” said Christy, “he had to cut and run from
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was arguing against his own hopes and chance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Janet, “I could have had him then. But it
would have been stealing. Breaking his loyalty. I’m not
like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s been too damned loyal,” said Christy. “My lady
Joyce chucked him as she would a broken toy. Why send
for her? Perhaps she won’t come, anyhow. The little
bitch!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll give her the chance,” said Janet, and she wrote
out the telegram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll play the game, for Bertram’s sake,” she said later.
“It may be the last thing we can do for him. Another
visitor may come before his wife gets here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it as bad as that?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know what typhus means. It burns quick. Oh,
my dear, I think my love is dying!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She wept a little, and Christy leaned over her and put
his hand on her shoulder and said, “Courage!” She took
hold of his hand and held it tight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Old Plesiosaurus! You’re a good friend in distress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But not a lucky lover!” he answered gloomily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When we set up house together,” she said, “you’ll
marvel at your luck!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed in her old gay way, even though her eyes
were still wet with tears, and Christy was comforted by
the promise of her words, and worshipful before this
woman whose spirit was so honest and so kind. Her love
for Bertram made no difference to him. Her comradeship
was gift enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Together they went each day to the hospital where Bertram
lay. The German doctors would not let them go into
his ward, because of infection, and their reports were not
comforting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Sehr krank! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Gross gefähr.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Es geht nicht
wohl.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bertram was very ill. He was in great danger. It was
not going well with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Janet who remembered that Bertram had a sister
in Berlin—the beautiful Dorothy, now Frau von Arenburg.
A note from her brought Dorothy and her husband to
Christy’s room, infinitely distressed by the grave news.
They haunted the hospital and Von Arenburg interviewed
the doctors, and in his rather Prussian way impressed them
with “the enormous importance” of Bertram’s recovery to
the friendly relations between England and Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anna von Wegener sent immense bouquets of hot-house
flowers which were never allowed to enter the sick man’s
room, and other German ladies whom Bertram had met at
his sister’s house were prodigal with fruit and flowers.
But Bertram, lying there in delirium, knew none of this
kindly remembrance from those whom he had called “the
Enemy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the crisis,” said the German doctors one day. “If
he lives through the night—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s pray a bit,” said Janet to her friend. “We’re both
infidels, but God will understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe in prayer,” said Christy. “I’m a blasphemer
and a heretic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So is all humanity,” said Janet. “But in time of trouble
we cry out to God, in spite of disbelief.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s our cowardice,” said Christy. “It’s the dark of the
mind. The primitive savage before the Ju-ju of his fears
and hopes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Children crying for help to the Eternal Father,” said
Janet. “Something like that, though I can’t get the hang
of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went together into a church somewhere off the
Wilhelmstrasse, and kneeling side by side, Christy and
Janet bent their heads and stayed in the silence and the
gloom before an altar with twinkling lights, and in their
queer way prayed to the Unknown God for Bertram, their
friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was your prayer?” asked Janet, when they came
out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christy smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much of a one. I said, ‘Oh, God, where in God’s
name are you? Why have you made such a mess of this
bloody old world?’ Then I kept on saying, ‘Oh, God!
Oh, God!’ until my mind went into a kind of coma, very
restful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine,” said Janet. “A real confession of faith.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was your prayer?” asked Christy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet could hardly remember her prayer. She had
offered her heart to the Unknown God, and said many
times, “Dear God!” and then, “Dear Bertram!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re weakening,” said Christy. “This is nonsense.
It’s a disgrace to the intellect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Janet, “I’m strengthened. I believe God will
like this little visit. I believe it’s a good thing to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anyhow, it won’t do God or Bertram any harm,” said
Christy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke in his sardonic way, but he, too, felt strangely
comforted and puzzled at the meaning of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they went back to the apartment house where
Christy had rooms, they found Joyce there waiting for them.
Neither of them had seen her before, and by a glance they
tried to take the measure of this girl who was Bertram’s
wife. She was very pale, and looked ill, but wonderfully
young and elegant, and exquisite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is my husband?” she asked, and that word “husband”
seemed strange on her lips, because of her youthful
girlish look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet told her that he was pretty bad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was good of you to wire to me,” Joyce said. “I am
deeply grateful to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He called to you many times on the night he was first
so ill,” said Janet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little mist came into Joyce’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t deserve his remembrance. I’ve been rotten to
him,” she said, humbly, and that humility and that confession
softened their hearts towards her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s been very loyal to you,” said Janet. “ ‘Sir Faithful,’
his friends call him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was disloyal,” said Joyce. “Perhaps he told you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at Janet Welford, and her face flamed with
colour. Perhaps in some way she guessed that Janet had
been Bertram’s best friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janet nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Things happen like that. Perhaps they can’t be helped.
It’s good if one gets a chance to patch things up. Life’s
mostly patchwork.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When can I see him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She saw him that night. His fever had left him—“Our
prayers!” said Janet—and the German doctors allowed
Joyce to sit for a little while by his bedside. He was sleeping
when she went into the ward where he lay alone, but
presently he awoke and opened his eyes, and looked at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo, Joyce,” he said, in a kind of whisper. “I’m not
dreaming again, am I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve come back,” she answered, and she put her arms
about him and wept, so that her tears fell on his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was silent for a little, while looking at her with a
faint smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean back for always?” he asked presently.
“As man and wife?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’ll have me,” she said. “Do you forgive me, Bertram,
for all my beastliness?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took her hand, and stroked the back of it with his
finger-tips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How beautiful you are!” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you forgive me, dear heart?” she asked again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush,” he said. “There’s nothing to forgive. We were
both kids.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little later he spoke again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry about Kenneth. Very rough on him and
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bowed her head, and was very white.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was best like that. It has let me come back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew a girl who died—in Russia—” said Bertram.
“One day I’ll tell you. Not now. How’s England and
Holme Ottery?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“England’s still there. Holme Ottery’s sold. I’ve a little
house close by. We’ll go back and live there. It’s ready
for our home-coming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Home-coming!” said Bertram. “How good that sounds!
I’ve been wandering alone since you left me, Joyce. Always
damned lonely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m with you now,” said Joyce. “Body and soul, Bertram.
The past is dead, and I’m changed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put his arms about her, and drew down her head until
it lay upon his breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s begin again,” he said. “We’re young enough.”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
